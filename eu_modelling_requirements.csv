Under those procedures, institutions shall consider several factors when determining whether a valuation adjustment is necessary for less liquid positions. Those factors include the following:
(a)the amount of time it would take to hedge out the position or the risks within the position;
(b)the volatility and average of bid/offer spreads;
(c)the availability of market quotes (number and identity of market makers) and the volatility and average of trading volumes including trading volumes during periods of market stress;
(d)market concentrations;
(e)the ageing of positions;
(f)the extent to which valuation relies on marking-to-model;
(g)the impact of other model risks."|251

(a)exposures to or guaranteed by central governments, ESCB central banks, public sector entities, regional governments or local authorities in the Union;
(b)exposures to or guaranteed by third country central governments, third-country central banks, multilateral development banks, international organisations that qualify for the credit quality step 1 as set out in this Chapter, and exposures to or guaranteed by third-country public sector entities, third-country regional governments or third-country local authorities that are risk weighted as exposures to institutions or central governments and central banks in accordance with Article 115(1) or (2), or Article 116(1), (2) or (4) respectively and that qualify for the credit quality step 1 as set out in this Chapter, and exposures within the meaning of this point that qualify as a minimum for the credit quality step 2 as set out in this Chapter, provided that they do not exceed 20 % of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing institutions;
(c)exposures to institutions that qualify for the credit quality step 1 as set out in this Chapter. The total exposure of this kind shall not exceed 15 % of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing institution.

(d)loans secured by:(i)residential property up to the lesser of the principal amount of the liens that are combined with any prior liens and 80 % of the value of the pledged properties; or(ii)senior units issued by French Fonds Communs de Titrisation or equivalent securitisation entities governed by the laws of a Member State securitising residential property exposures. In the event of such senior units being used as collateral, the special public supervision to protect bond holders as provided for in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC shall ensure that the assets underlying such units shall, at any time while they are included in the cover pool be at least 90 % composed of residential mortgages that are combined with any prior liens up to the lesser of the principal amounts due under the units, the principal amounts of the liens, and 80 % of the value of the pledged properties, that the units qualify for the credit quality step 1 as set out in this Chapter and that such units do not exceed 10 % of the nominal amount of the outstanding issue.
(e)residential loans fully guaranteed by an eligible protection provider referred to in Article 201 qualifying for the credit quality step 2 or above as set out in this Chapter, where the portion of each of the loans that is used to meet the requirement set out in this paragraph for collateralisation of the covered bond does not represent more than 80 % of the value of the corresponding residential property located in France, and where a loan-to-income ratio respects at most 33 % when the loan has been granted. There shall be no mortgage liens on the residential property when the loan is granted, and for the loans granted from 1 January 2014 the borrower shall be contractually committed not to grant such liens without the consent of the credit institution that granted the loan. The loan-to-income ratio represents the share of the gross income of the borrower that covers the reimbursement of the loan, including the interests. The protection provider shall be either a financial institution authorised and supervised by the competent authorities and subject to prudential requirements comparable to those applied to institutions in terms of robustness or an institution or an insurance undertaking. It shall establish a mutual guarantee fund or equivalent protection for insurance undertakings to absorb credit risk losses, whose calibration shall be periodically reviewed by the competent authorities. Both the credit institution and the protection provider shall carry out a creditworthiness assessment of the borrower;

In the event of such senior units being used as collateral, the special public supervision to protect bond holders as provided for in Article 52(4) of Directive 2009/65/EC shall ensure that the assets underlying such units shall, at any time while they are included in the cover pool be at least 90 % composed of commercial mortgages that are combined with any prior liens up to the lesser of the principal amounts due under the units, the principal amounts of the liens, and 60 % of the value of the pledged properties, that the units qualify for the credit quality step 1 as set out in this Chapter and that such units do not exceed 10 % of the nominal amount of the outstanding issue.Loans secured by commercial immovable property are eligible where the Loan to Value ratio of 60 % is exceeded up to a maximum level of 70 % if the value of the total assets pledged as collateral for the covered bonds exceed the nominal amount outstanding on the covered bond by at least 10 %, and the bondholders' claim meets the legal certainty requirements set out in Chapter 4. The bondholders' claim shall take priority over all other claims on the collateral;
(g)loans secured by maritime liens on ships up to the difference between 60 % of the value of the pledged ship and the value of any prior maritime liens.
For the purposes of points (c), (d)(ii) and (f)(ii) of the first subparagraph, exposures caused by transmission and management of payments of the obligors of, or liquidation proceeds in respect of, loans secured by pledged properties of the senior units or debt securities shall not be comprised in calculating the limits referred to in those points.
The competent authorities may, after consulting EBA, partly waive the application of point (c) of the first subparagraph and allow credit quality step 2 for up to 10 % of the total exposure of the nominal amount of outstanding covered bonds of the issuing institution, provided that significant potential concentration problems in the Member States concerned can be documented due to the application of the credit quality step 1 requirement referred to in that point."|1433

(a)an institution's own estimates of the risk parameters PD, LGD, conversion factor and EL shall incorporate all relevant data, information and methods. The estimates shall be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on judgemental considerations. The estimates shall be plausible and intuitive and shall be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. The less data an institution has, the more conservative it shall be in its estimation;
(b)an institution shall be able to provide a breakdown of its loss experience in terms of default frequency, LGD, conversion factor, or loss where EL estimates are used, by the factors it sees as the drivers of the respective risk parameters. The institution's estimates shall be representative of long run experience;
(c)any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation periods referred to in Article 180(1)(h) and (2)(e), Article 181(1)(j) and (2), and Article 182(2) and (3) shall be taken into account. An institution's estimates shall reflect the implications of technical advances and new data and other information, as it becomes available. Institutions shall review their estimates when new information comes to light but at least on an annual basis;
(d)the population of exposures represented in the data used for estimation, the lending standards used when the data was generated and other relevant characteristics shall be comparable with those of the institution's exposures and standards. The economic or market conditions that underlie the data shall be relevant to current and foreseeable conditions. The number of exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification shall be sufficient to provide the institution with confidence in the accuracy and robustness of its estimates;
(e)for purchased receivables the estimates shall reflect all relevant information available to the purchasing institution regarding the quality of the underlying receivables, including data for similar pools provided by the seller, by the purchasing institution, or by external sources. The purchasing institution shall evaluate any data relied upon which is provided by the seller;
(f)an institution shall add to its estimates a margin of conservatism that is related to the expected range of estimation errors. Where methods and data are considered to be less satisfactory, the expected range of errors is larger, the margin of conservatism shall be larger.
Where institutions use different estimates for the calculation of risk weights and for internal purposes, it shall be documented and be reasonable. If institutions can demonstrate to their competent authorities that for data that have been collected prior to 1 January 2007 appropriate adjustments have been made to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default laid down in Article 178 or with loss, competent authorities may permit the institutions some flexibility in the application of the required standards for data."|630

In quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools, institutions shall apply the following requirements specific to PD estimation to exposures to corporates, institutions and central governments and central banks and for equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3):
(a)institutions shall estimate PDs by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year default rates. PD estimates for obligors that are highly leveraged or for obligors whose assets are predominantly traded assets shall reflect the performance of the underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities;
(b)for purchased corporate receivables institutions may estimate the EL by obligor grade from long run averages of one-year realised default rates;
(c)if an institution derives long run average estimates of PDs and LGDs for purchased corporate receivables from an estimate of EL, and an appropriate estimate of PD or LGD, the process for estimating total losses shall meet the overall standards for estimation of PD and LGD set out in this part, and the outcome shall be consistent with the concept of LGD as set out in Article 181(1)(a);
(d)institutions shall use PD estimation techniques only with supporting analysis. Institutions shall recognise the importance of judgmental considerations in combining results of techniques and in making adjustments for limitations of techniques and information;
(e)to the extent that an institution uses data on internal default experience for the estimation of PDs, the estimates shall be reflective of underwriting standards and of any differences in the rating system that generated the data and the current rating system. Where underwriting standards or rating systems have changed, the institution shall add a greater margin of conservatism in its estimate of PD;
(f)to the extent that an institution associates or maps its internal grades to the scale used by an ECAI or similar organisations and then attributes the default rate observed for the external organisation's grades to the institution's grades, mappings shall be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria to the criteria used by the external organisation and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common obligors. Biases or inconsistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data shall be avoided. The criteria of the external organisation underlying the data used for quantification shall be oriented to default risk only and not reflect transaction characteristics. The analysis undertaken by the institution shall include a comparison of the default definitions used, subject to the requirements in Article 178. The institution shall document the basis for the mapping;
(g)to the extent that an institution uses statistical default prediction models it is allowed to estimate PDs as the simple average of default-probability estimates for individual obligors in a given grade. The institution's use of default probability models for this purpose shall meet the standards specified in Article 174;
(h)irrespective of whether an institution is using external, internal, or pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for its PD estimation, the length of the underlying historical observation period used shall be at least five years for at least one source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and this data is relevant, this longer period shall be used. This point also applies to the PD/LGD Approach to equity. Subject to the permission of competent authorities, institutions which have not received the permission of the competent authority pursuant to Article 143 to use own estimates of LGDs or conversion factors may use, when they implement the IRB Approach, relevant data covering a period of two years.

(b)PD estimates may also be derived from an estimate of total losses and appropriate estimates of LGDs;
(c)institutions shall regard internal data for assigning exposures to grades or pools as the primary source of information for estimating loss characteristics. Institutions may use external data (including pooled data) or statistical models for quantification provided the following strong links both exist:(i)between the institution's process of assigning exposures to grades or pools and the process used by the external data source; and(ii)between the institution's internal risk profile and the composition of the external data;
(d)if an institution derives long run average estimates of PD and LGD for retail from an estimate of total losses and an appropriate estimate of PD or LGD, the process for estimating total losses shall meet the overall standards for estimation of PD and LGD set out in this part, and the outcome shall be consistent with the concept of LGD as set out in point (a) of Article 181(1);

(b)institutions shall use LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average. To the extent a rating system is expected to deliver realised LGDs at a constant level by grade or pool over time, institutions shall make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn;

(d)currency mismatches between the underlying obligation and the collateral shall be treated conservatively in the institution's assessment of LGD;

Such an approach shall be applied conservatively and consistently over time. Where only limited relevant data is available the institution shall add appropriate margins of conservatism;
(b)the models used shall capture adequately all of the material risks embodied in equity returns including both the general market risk and specific risk exposure of the institution's equity portfolio. The internal models shall adequately explain historical price variation, capture both the magnitude and changes in the composition of potential concentrations, and be robust to adverse market environments. The population of risk exposures represented in the data used for estimation shall be closely matched to or at least comparable with those of the institution's equity exposures;
(c)the internal model shall be appropriate for the risk profile and complexity of an institution's equity portfolio. Where an institution has material holdings with values that are highly non-linear in nature the internal models shall be designed to capture appropriately the risks associated with such instruments;
(d)mapping of individual positions to proxies, market indices, and risk factors shall be plausible, intuitive, and conceptually sound;
(e)institutions shall demonstrate through empirical analyses the appropriateness of risk factors, including their ability to cover both general and specific risk;
(f)the estimates of the return volatility of equity exposures shall incorporate relevant and available data, information, and methods. Independently reviewed internal data or data from external sources including pooled data shall be used;

(l)the aggregated estimate of loss on an asset pool that the ABCP programme is considering purchasing shall take into account all sources of potential risk, such as credit and dilution risk. If the seller-provided credit enhancement is sized based only on credit-related losses, then a separate reserve shall be established for dilution risk, if dilution risk is material for the particular exposure pool. In addition, in sizing the required enhancement level, the program shall review several years of historical information, including losses, delinquencies, dilutions, and the turnover rate of the receivables;

That back-testing shall consider a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various initialisation dates and covering a wide range of market conditions;
(b)the institution using the approach set out in Article 285(1)(b) shall regularly validate its model to test whether realised current exposures are consistent with prediction over all margin periods within one year. If some of the trades in the netting set have a maturity of less than one year, and the netting set has higher risk factor sensitivities without these trades, the validation shall take this into account;
(c)it shall back-test the performance of its CCR exposure model and the model's relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions. For collateralised trades, the prediction time horizons considered shall include those reflecting typical margin periods of risk applied in collateralised or margined trading;
(d)if the model validation indicates that effective EPE is underestimated, the institution shall take the action necessary to address the inaccuracy of the model;
(e)it shall test the pricing models used to calculate CCR exposure for a given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors as part of the initial and on-going model validation process. Pricing models for options shall account for the nonlinearity of option value with respect to market risk factors;
(f)the CCR exposure model shall capture the transaction-specific information necessary to be able to aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set. An institution shall verify that transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model;
(g)the CCR exposure model shall include transaction-specific information to capture the effects of margining. It shall take into account both the current amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model shall account for the nature of margin agreements that are unilateral or bilateral, the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the minimum threshold of un-margined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model shall either estimate the mark-to-market change in the value of collateral posted or apply the rules set out in Chapter 4;
(h)the model validation process shall include static, historical back-testing on representative counterparty portfolios. An institution shall conduct such back-testing on a number of representative counterparty portfolios that are actual or hypothetical at regular intervals. Those representative portfolios shall be chosen on the basis of their sensitivity to the material risk factors and combinations of risk factors to which the institution is exposed;
(i)an institution shall conduct back-testing that is designed to test the key assumptions of the CCR exposure model and the relevant risk measures, including the modelled relationship between tenors of the same risk factor, and the modelled relationships between risk factors;
(j)the performance of CCR exposure models and its risk measures shall be subject to appropriate back-testing practice. The back testing programme shall be capable of identifying poor performance in an EPE model's risk measures;
(k)an institution shall validate its CCR exposure models and all risk measures out to time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure is calculated using IMM in accordance to the Article 283;
(l)an institution shall regularly test the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the on-going model validation process;
(m)the on-going validation of an institution's CCR exposure model and the relevant risk measures shall include an assessment of the adequacy of the recent performance;
(n)the frequency with which the parameters of an CCR exposure model are updated shall be assessed by an institution as part of the initial and on-going validation process;
(o)the initial and on-going validation of CCR exposure models shall assess whether or not the counterparty level and netting set exposure calculations of exposure are appropriate."|877

(c)credit risk to each counterparty is aggregated to arrive at a single legal exposure across transactions with each counterparty. This aggregation shall be factored into credit limit purposes and internal capital purposes;
(d)the contract shall not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or no payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting party, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor (i.e. walk away clause).
If any of the competent authorities are not satisfied that the contractual netting is legally valid and enforceable under the law of each of the jurisdictions referred to in point (b) the contractual netting agreement shall not be recognised as risk-reducing for either of the counterparties. Competent authorities shall inform each other accordingly."|454

Interest-rate futures, forward-rate agreements (FRAs) and forward commitments to buy or sell debt instruments shall be treated as combinations of long and short positions. Thus a long interest-rate futures position shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date of the futures contract and a holding of an asset with maturity date equal to that of the instrument or notional position underlying the futures contract in question. Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date. Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 in order to calculate the own funds requirement for specific risk for interest-rate futures and FRAs. A forward commitment to buy a debt instrument shall be treated as a combination of a borrowing maturing on the delivery date and a long (spot) position in the debt instrument itself. The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in Article 336 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table.|288

Options and warrants on interest rates, debt instruments, equities, equity indices, financial futures, swaps and foreign currencies shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying instrument to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Chapter. The latter positions may be netted off against any offsetting positions in the identical underlying securities or derivatives. The delta used shall be that of the exchange concerned. For OTC-options, or where delta is not available from the exchange concerned, the institution may calculate delta itself using an appropriate model, subject to permission by the competent authorities. Permission shall be granted if the model appropriately estimates the rate of change of the option's or warrant's value with respect to small changes in the market price of the underlying.|204

Thus, an interest-rate swap under which an institution receives floating-rate interest and pays fixed-rate interest shall be treated as equivalent to a long position in a floating-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument with the same maturity as the swap itself.|124

Institutions which mark to market and manage the interest-rate risk on the derivative instruments covered in Articles 328 to 330 on a discounted-cash-flow basis may, subject to permission by the competent authorities, use sensitivity models to calculate the positions referred to in those Articles and may use them for any bond which is amortised over its residual life rather than via one final repayment of principal. Permission shall be granted if these models generate positions which have the same sensitivity to interest-rate changes as the underlying cash flows. This sensitivity shall be assessed with reference to independent movements in sample rates across the yield curve, with at least one sensitivity point in each of the maturity bands set out in Table 2 in Article 339. The positions shall be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for general risk of debt instruments.|208
798|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 332|Other|TITLE IV - OWN FUNDS REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKET RISK > CHAPTER 2 - Own funds requirements for position risk > Section 1 - General provisions and specific instruments > Article 332 - Credit Derivatives|"1. When calculating the own funds requirement for general and specific risk of the party who assumes the credit risk (the ‧protection seller‧), unless specified differently, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. For the purpose of calculating the specific risk charge, other than for total return swaps, the maturity of the credit derivative contract, rather than the maturity of the obligation, shall apply. Positions are determined as follows:
(a)a total return swap creates a long position in the general risk of the reference obligation and a short position in the general risk of a government bond with a maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and which is assigned a 0 % risk weight under Title II, Chapter 2. It also creates a long position in the specific risk of the reference obligation;
(b)a credit default swap does not create a position for general risk. For the purposes of specific risk, the institution shall record a synthetic long position in an obligation of the reference entity, unless the derivative is rated externally and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, in which case a long position in the derivative is recorded. If premium or interest payments are due under the product, these cash flows shall be represented as notional positions in government bonds;
(c)a single name credit linked note creates a long position in the general risk of the note itself, as an interest rate product. For the purpose of specific risk, a synthetic long position is created in an obligation of the reference entity. An additional long position is created in the issuer of the note. Where the credit linked note has an external rating and meets the conditions for a qualifying debt item, a single long position with the specific risk of the note need only be recorded;
(d)in addition to a long position in the specific risk of the issuer of the note, a multiple name credit linked note providing proportional protection creates a position in each reference entity, with the total notional amount of the contract assigned across the positions according to the proportion of the total notional amount that each exposure to a reference entity represents. Where more than one obligation of a reference entity can be selected, the obligation with the highest risk weighting determines the specific risk;
(e)a first-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, the maximum payment amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.
A -n-th-asset-to-default credit derivative creates a position for the notional amount in an obligation of each reference entity less the n-1 reference entities with the lowest specific risk own funds requirement. If the size of the maximum credit event payment is lower than the own funds requirement under the method in the first sentence of this point, this amount may be taken as the own funds requirement for specific risk.
Where an n-th-to-default credit derivative is externally rated, the protection seller shall calculate the specific risk own funds requirement using the rating of the derivative and apply the respective securitisation risk weights as applicable."|728

For the party who transfers credit risk (the protection buyer), the positions are determined as the mirror principle of the protection seller, with the exception of a credit linked note (which entails no short position in the issuer). When calculating the own funds requirement for the ‧protection buyer‧, the notional amount of the credit derivative contract shall be used. Notwithstanding the first sentence, the institution may elect to replace the notional value by the notional value plus the net market value change of the credit derivative since trade inception, a net downward change from the protection seller's perspective carrying a negative sign. If at a given moment there is a call option in combination with a step-up, such moment is treated as the maturity of the protection.|196

An institution other than an originator institution that could apply it for the same securitisation position in its non-trading book may only use that method subject to permission by the competent authorities, which shall be granted where the institution fulfils the condition in the first subparagraph.
Estimates of PD and LGD as inputs to the Supervisory Formula Method may alternatively also be determined based on estimates that are derived from an IRC approach of an institution that has been granted permission to use an internal model for specific risk of debt instruments. The latter alternative may be used only subject to permission by the competent authorities, which shall be granted if those estimates meet the quantitative requirements for the Internal Ratings Based Approach set out in Title II, Chapter 3.
In accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, EBA shall issue guidelines on the use of estimates of PD and LGD as inputs when those estimates are based on an IRC approach."|317

Any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for position risk, foreign exchange risk or commodities risk shall meet all of the following requirements:
(a)the model shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off-balance sheet positions. The institution shall model the yield curves using one of the generally accepted approaches. For material exposures to interest-rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve shall be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between different yield curves;
(b)the model shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated. For CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account. Institutions may rely on third party reporting of the foreign exchange position of the CIU, where the correctness of that report is adequately ensured. If an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU, this position shall be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 353(3);
(c)the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each of the equity markets in which the institution holds significant positions;
(d)the model shall use a separate risk factor at least for each commodity in which the institution holds significant positions. The model shall also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the exposure to changes in forward prices arising from maturity mismatches. It shall also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions;
(e)the institution's internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model shall meet minimum data standards. Proxies shall be appropriately conservative and shall be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of the true volatility of a position or portfolio."|465

Pending specification of a uniform definition in accordance with Article 460 of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality, institutions shall identify themselves in a given currency transferable assets that are respectively of high or extremely high liquidity and credit quality. Pending specification of a uniform definition, competent authorities may, taking into account the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5) provide general guidance that institutions shall follow in identifying assets of high and extremely high liquidity and credit quality. In the absence of such guidance, institutions shall use transparent and objective criteria to this end, including some or all of the criteria listed in Article 509(3), (4) and (5)."|532
974|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 416|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 416 - Reporting on liquid assets|"2. The following shall not be considered liquid assets:

(b)they are not issued by the institution itself or its parent or subsidiary institutions or another subsidiary of its parent institutions or parent financial holding company;
(c)their price is generally agreed upon by markets participants and can easily be observed in the market, or their price can be determined by a formula that is easy to calculate based on publicly available inputs and does not depend on strong assumptions as is typically the case for structured or exotic products;

The conditions referred to in points (c), (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to the assets referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1.
The condition referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph shall not apply in the case of liquid assets held to meet liquidity outflows in a currency in which there is an extremely narrow definition of central bank eligibility. In the case of liquid assets denominated in currencies of third countries, this exception shall apply and only apply if the competent authorities of the third country apply the same or an equivalent exception."|370

Shares or units in CIUs may be treated as liquid assets up to an absolute amount of EUR 500 million in the portfolio of liquid assets of each institution provided that the requirements in Article 132(3) are met and that the CIU, apart from derivatives to mitigate interest rate or credit or currency risk, only invests in liquid assets as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
The use or potential use by a CIU of derivative instruments to hedge risks of permitted investments shall not prevent that CIU from being eligible. Where the value of the shares or units of the CIU is not regularly marked to market by the third parties referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 418(4) and the competent authority is not satisfied that an institution has developed robust methodologies and processes for such valuation as referred to in the first sentence of Article 418(4), shares or units in that CIU shall not be treated as liquid assets."|217

(a)they are appropriately diversified. Diversification is not required in terms of assets corresponding to points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);
(b)they are legally and practically readily available at any time during the next 30 days to be liquidated via outright sale or via a simple repurchase agreement on approved repurchase markets in order to meet obligations coming due. Liquid assets referred to in point (c) of Article 416(1) which are held in third countries where there are transfer restrictions or which are denominated in non-convertible currencies shall be considered available only to the extent that they correspond to outflows in the third country or currency in question, unless the institution can demonstrate to the competent authorities that it has appropriately hedged the ensuing currency risk;
(c)the liquid assets are controlled by a liquidity management function;
(d)a portion of the liquid assets except those referred to in points (a), (c) and (e) of Article 416(1) is periodically and at least annually liquidated via outright sale or via simple repurchase agreements on an approved repurchase market for the following purposes:(i)to test the access to the market for these assets;(ii)to test the effectiveness of its processes for the liquidation of assets;(iii)to test the usability of the assets;(iv)to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of stress;
(e)price risks associated with the assets may be hedged but the liquid assets are subject to appropriate internal arrangements that ensure that they are readily available to the treasury when needed and especially that they are not used in other ongoing operations, including:(i)hedging or other trading strategies;(ii)providing credit enhancements in structured transactions;(iii)covering operational costs.
(f)the denomination of the liquid assets is consistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows."|428
980|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 418|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 418 - Valuation of liquid assets|1. The value of a liquid asset to be reported shall be its market value, subject to appropriate haircuts that reflect at least the duration, the credit and liquidity risk and typical repo haircuts in periods of general market stress. The haircuts shall not be less than 15 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1). If the institution hedges the price risk associated with an asset, it shall take into account the cash flow resulting from the potential close-out of the hedge.|125
981|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 418|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 418 - Valuation of liquid assets|"2.

(b)5 % for the assets referred to in points (b) and (c) of Article 416(1);
(c)20 % for the assets referred to in point (d) of Article 416(1)."|121
982|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 418|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 418 - Valuation of liquid assets|"3. The look-through approach referred to in paragraph 2 shall be applied as follows:
(a)where the institution is aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it may look through to those underlying exposures in order to assign them to points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1);
(b)where the institution is not aware of the underlying exposures of a CIU, it shall be assumed that the CIU invests, to the maximum extent allowed under its mandate, in descending order in the asset types referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 416(1) until the maximum total investment limit is reached."|154

984|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 419|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 419 - Currencies with constraints on the availability of liquid assets|"2. Where the justified needs for liquid assets in light of the requirement in Article 412 are exceeding the availability of those liquid assets in a currency, one or more of the following derogations shall apply:
(a)by way of derogation from point (f) of Article 417, the denomination of the liquid assets may be inconsistent with the distribution by currency of liquidity outflows after the deduction of inflows;
(b)for currencies of a Member State or third countries, required liquid assets may be substituted by credit lines from the central bank of that Member State or third country, which are contractually irrevocably committed for the next 30 days and are fairly priced, independent of the amount currently drawn, provided that the competent authorities of that Member State or third country do the same and that Member State or third country has comparable reporting requirements in place."|197
985|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 419|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 419 - Currencies with constraints on the availability of liquid assets|3. The derogations applied in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be inversely proportional to the availability of the relevant assets. The justified needs of institutions shall be assessed taking into account their ability to reduce, by sound liquidity management, the need for those liquid assets and the holdings of those assets by other market participants.|88

(b)the current amounts outstanding of other liabilities that come due, can be called for payout by the issuing institutions or by the provider of the funding or entail an implicit expectation of the provider of the funding that the institution would repay the liability during the next 30 days as set out in Article 422;
(c)the additional outflows referred to in Article 423;
(d)the maximum amount that can be drawn during the next 30 days from undrawn committed credit and liquidity facilities, as set out in Article 424;

(b)held in a transactional account, including accounts to which salaries are regularly credited."|105
989|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 421|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 421 - Outflows on retail deposits|2. Institutions shall multiply other retail deposits not referred to in paragraph 1 by at least 10 %.|41
990|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 421|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 421 - Outflows on retail deposits|3. Taking into account the behaviour of local depositors as advised by competent authorities, EBA shall issue guidelines by 1 January 2014 on the criteria to determine the conditions of application of paragraphs 1 and 2 in relation to the identification of retail deposits subject to different outflows and the definitions of those products for purposes of this Title. Those guidelines shall take account of the likelihood of these deposits to lead to outflows of liquidity during the next 30 days. These outflows shall be assessed under the assumption of a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenario.|138
991|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 421|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 421 - Outflows on retail deposits|4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, institutions shall multiply retail deposits that they have taken in third countries by a higher percentage than provided for in those paragraphs if such percentage is provided by comparable third country reporting requirements.|65

Clearing, custody or cash management or other comparable services referred to in points (a) and (d) of paragraph 3 only covers such services to the extent that they are rendered in the context of an established relationship on which the depositor has substantial dependency. They shall not merely consist in correspondent banking or prime brokerage services and the institution shall have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30 day horizon without compromising its operational functioning.
Pending a uniform definition of an established operational relationship as referred to in point (c) of paragraph 3, institutions shall themselves establish the criteria to identify an established operational relationship for which they have evidence that the client is unable to withdraw amounts legally due over a 30 day horizon without compromising their operational functioning and shall report these criteria to the competent authorities. Competent authorities may, in the absence of a uniform definition, provide general guidance that institutions shall follow in identifying deposits maintained by the depositor in a context of an established operational relationship."|222

Competent authorities may waive the conditions set out in point (d) of paragraph 8 where point (b) of Article 20(1) is applied. In that case additional objective criteria as set out in the delegated act referred to in Article 460 have to be met. Where such lower outflow is permitted to be applied, the competent authorities shall inform EBA about the result of the process referred to in point (b) of Article 20(1). The fulfilment of the conditions for such lower outflows shall be regularly reviewed by the competent authorities.|137
1001|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 423|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 423 - Additional Outflows|1. Collateral other than assets referred to in Article 416(1)(a), (b) and (c), which is posted by the institution for contracts listed in Annex II and credit derivatives, shall be subject to an additional outflow of 20 %.|71

Institutions shall notify to the competent authorities all contracts entered into the contractual conditions of which lead, within 30 days following a material deterioration of the credit quality of the institution, to liquidity outflows or additional collateral needs. If the competent authorities consider such contracts material in relation to the potential liquidity outflows of the institution, they shall require the institution to add an additional outflow for those contracts corresponding to the additional collateral needs resulting from a material deterioration in the credit quality of the institution such as a downgrade in its external credit assessment by three notches. The institution shall regularly review the extent of this material deterioration in light of what is relevant under the contracts it has entered into and shall notify the result of its review to the competent authorities.|166
1003|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 423|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 423 - Additional Outflows|"3. The institution shall add an additional outflow corresponding to collateral needs that would result from the impact of an adverse market scenario on the institution's derivatives transactions, financing transactions and other contracts if material.
EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the conditions of application in relation to the notion of materiality and methods for the measurement of this additional outflow.
EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2014.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the second subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010."|151

(b)collateral that is due to be returned to a counterparty;
(c)collateral that corresponds to assets that would qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416 that can be substituted for assets corresponding to assets that would not qualify as liquid assets for the purposes of Article 416 without the consent of the institution."|119
1006|Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR): REGULATION (EU) No 575/2013|Article 424|Other|TITLE II - LIQUIDITY REPORTING > Article 424 - Outflows from credit and liquidity facilities|1. Institutions shall report outflows from committed credit facilities and committed liquidity facilities, which shall be determined as a percentage of the maximum amount that can be drawn within the next 30 days. This maximum amount that can be drawn may be assessed net of any liquidity requirement that would be mandated under Article 420(2) for the trade finance off-balance sheet items and net of the value in accordance with Article 418 of collateral to be provided if the institution can reuse the collateral and if the collateral is held in the form of liquid assets in accordance with Article 416.

The power to adopt an implementing act to reject the draft national measures referred to in point (d) of paragraph 2 is conferred on the Council, acting by qualified majority, on a proposal from the Commission.
Within one month of receiving the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the ESRB and EBA shall provide their opinions on the points mentioned in that paragraph to the Council, the Commission and the Member State concerned.
Taking utmost account of the opinions referred to in the second subparagraph and if there is robust, strong and detailed evidence that the measure will have a negative impact on the internal market that outweighs the financial stability benefits resulting in a reduction of the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, the Commission may, within one month, propose to the Council an implementing act to reject the draft national measures.
In the absence of a Commission proposal within that period of one month, the Member State concerned may immediately adopt the draft national measures for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner.
The Council shall decide on the proposal by the Commission within one month after receipt of the proposal and state its reasons for rejecting or not rejecting the draft national measures.
The Council shall only reject the draft national measures if it considers that one or more of the following conditions are not complied with:
(a)the changes in the intensity of macroprudential or systemic risk are of such nature as to pose risk to financial stability at national level;
(b)Articles 124 and 164 of this Regulation and Articles 101, 103, 104, 105, 133, and 136 of Directive 2013/36/EU cannot adequately address the macroprudential or systemic risk identified, taking into account the relative effectiveness of those measures;
(c)the draft national measures are more suitable to address the identified macroprudential or systemic risk and do not entail disproportionate adverse effects on the whole or parts of the financial system in other Member States or in the Union as a whole, thus forming or creating an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market;
(d)the issue concerns only one Member State; and
(e)the risks have not already been addressed by other measures in this Regulation or in Directive 2013/36/EU.
The assessment of the Council shall take into account the opinion of the ESRB and EBA and shall be based on the evidence presented in accordance with paragraph 2 by the authority determined in accordance with paragraph 1.
In the absence of a Council implementing act to reject the draft national measures within one month after receipt of the proposal by the Commission, the Member State may adopt the measures and apply them for a period of up to two years or until the macroprudential or systemic risk ceases to exist if that occurs sooner."|618

Institutions that have received permission to use the IRB Approach should apply the 
requirements set out in these guidelines for the IRB Approach to all exposures. Where those 
institutions have received prior permission to permanently use the Standardised Approach in 
accordance with Article 150 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, or permission to implement the 
IRB Approach sequentially in accordance with Article 148 of that Regulation, may apply the

requirements of these guidelines in their internal procedures and IT systems by that time, but 
competent authorities may accelerate the timeline of this transition at their discretion."|57
1234|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 11|Definition of Default|3 Implementation > First application of the Guidelines by IRB institutions|"11. In order to apply these guidelines for the first time, institutions that use the IRB Approach 
should assess and accordingly adjust, where necessary, their rating systems so that the 
estimates of risk parameters reflect the new definition of default according to these 
guidelines by applying the following: 
(a) where possible, adjust the historical data based on the new definition of default 
according to these guidelines, including in particular as a result of the materiality 
thresholds for past due credit obligations referred to in point (d) of Article 178(2) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; 
(b) assess the materiality of impact on all risk parameters and own funds requirements of 
the new definition of default according to these guidelines and compared to the 
previous definition, where applicable, after the relevant adjustments in historical 
data; 
(c) include an additional margin of conservatism in their rating systems in order to 
account for the possible distortions of risk estimates resulting from the inconsistent 
definition of default in the historical data used for modelling purposes."|232
1235|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 12|Definition of Default|3 Implementation > First application of the Guidelines by IRB institutions|"12. The changes referred to in paragraph 11, which are applied to the rating systems as a result of 
the application of these guidelines, are required to be verified by the internal validation 
function and classified according to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, and, 
depending on this classification, they are required to be notified or approved by the relevant 
competent authority."|96
1236|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 13|Definition of Default|3 Implementation > First application of the Guidelines by IRB institutions|"13.

competent authorities in accordance with Article 143 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and 
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, should agree with their competent 
authorities the final deadline for submitting the application for the approval of changes in the

1237|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 14|Definition of Default|3 Implementation > First application of the Guidelines by IRB institutions|"14. After IRB institutions have started collecting data according to the new definition of default as 
provided in these guidelines, in the course of their regular revision of risk estimates referred 
to in Article 179(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, those institutions should extend or, 
where justified, move the window of historical data used for the risk quantification to include 
new data. Until an adequate time period with homogenous default definition is reached, 
those IRB institutions, during their regular revisions of the risk parameter estimates, should 
assess the adequacy of the level of the margin of conservatism referred to in point (b) of 
paragraph 11."|156

For the purposes of the application of point (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013, where any amount of principal, interest or fee has not been paid at the date it was 
due, institutions should recognise this as the credit obligation past due. Where there are 
modifications of the schedule of credit obligations, as referred to in point (e) of Article 178(2) 
of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the institution’s policies should clarify that the counting of 
days past due should be based on the modified schedule of payments."|146
1240|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 17|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Counting of days past due|"17. Where the credit arrangement explicitly allows the obligor to change the schedule, suspend 
or postpone the payments under certain conditions and the obligor acts within the rights 
granted in the contract, the changed, suspended or postponed instalments should not be 
considered past due, but the counting of days past due should be based on the new schedule 
once it is specified. Nevertheless if the obligor changes the schedule, suspends or postpones 
the payments, the institutions should analyse the reasons for such a change and assess the 
possible indications of unlikeliness to pay, in accordance with Articles 178(1) and (3) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Section 5 of these guidelines."|169
1241|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 18|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Counting of days past due|"18. Where the repayment of the obligation is suspended because of a law allowing this option or 
other legal restrictions, the counting of days past due should also be suspended during that 
period. Nevertheless, in such situations, institutions should analyse, where possible, the 
reasons for exercising the option for such a suspension and should assess the possible 
indications of unlikeliness to pay, in accordance with Articles 178(1) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 
No 575/2013 and Section 5 of these guidelines."|128
1242|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 19|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Counting of days past due|"19. Where the repayment of the obligation is the subject of a dispute between the obligor and 
the institution, the counting of days past due may be suspended until the dispute is resolved, 
where at least one of the following conditions is met: 
(a) the dispute between the obligor and the institution over the existence or amount of 
the credit obligation has been introduced to a court or another formal procedure 
performed by a dedicated external body that results in a binding ruling in accordance 
with the applicable legal framework in the relevant jurisdiction; 
(b) in the specific case of leasing, a formal complaint has been directed to the institution 
about the object of the contract and the merit of the complaint has been confirmed 
by independent internal audit, internal validation or another comparable 
independent auditing unit."|178
1243|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 20|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Counting of days past due|"20. Where the obligor changes due to an event such as a merger or acquisition of the obligor or 
any other similar transaction, the counting of days past due should start from the moment a 
different person or entity becomes obliged to pay the obligation. The counting of days past 
due is, instead, unaffected by a change in the obligor’s name."|91
1244|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 21|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Counting of days past due|"21. The calculation of the sum of all amounts past due that are related to any credit obligation of 
the obligor to the institution, parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries to this obligor and 
which institutions are required to calculate for the purpose of comparison with the 
materiality threshold set by the competent authority in accordance with point (d) of Article 
178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be performed with a frequency allowing timely 
identification of default. Institutions should ensure that the information about the days past 
due and default is up-to-date whenever it’s being used for decision making, internal risk 
management, internal or external reporting and the own funds requirements calculation 
processes. Where institutions calculate days past due less often than daily, they should 
ensure that the date of default is identified as the date when the past due criterion has 
actually been fulfilled."|200
1245|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 22|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Counting of days past due|"22. The classification of the obligor to a defaulted status should not be subject to additional 
expert judgement; once the obligor meets the past due criterion all exposures to that obligor 
are considered defaulted, unless either of the following conditions is met: 
(a) the exposures are eligible as retail exposures and the institution applies the default 
definition at individual credit facility level; 
(b) a so called ‘technical past due situation’ is considered to have occurred, in accordance 
with paragraph 23."|118
1246|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 23|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Technical past due situation|"23. A technical past due situation should only be considered to have occurred in any of the 
following cases: 
(a) where an institution identifies that the defaulted status was a result of data or system 
error of the institution, including manual errors of standardised processes but 
excluding wrong credit decisions; 
(b) where an institution identifies that the defaulted status was a result of the non-
execution, defective or late execution of the payment transaction ordered by the 
obligor or where there is evidence that the payment was unsuccessful due to the 
failure of the payment system; 
(c) where due to the nature of the transaction there is a time lag between the receipt of 
the payment by an institution and the allocation of that payment to the relevant 
account, so that the payment was made before the 90 days and the crediting in the 
client’s account took place after the 90 days past due; 
(d) in the specific case of factoring arrangements where the purchased receivables are 
recorded on the balance sheet of the institution and the materiality threshold set by 
the competent authority in accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013 is breached but none of the receivables to the obligor is past due 
more than 30 days."|287
1247|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 24|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Technical past due situation|"24. Technical past due situations should not be considered as defaults in accordance with Article 
178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. All detected errors that led to technical past due 
situation should be rectified by institutions in the shortest timeframe possible. 
In the case of institutions that use the IRB Approach, technical past due situations should be 
removed from the reference data set of defaulted exposures for the purpose of estimation of 
risk parameters."|108
1248|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 25|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Exposures to central governments, local authorities and public|"25. Institutions may apply specific treatment for exposures to central governments, local 
authorities and public sector entities where all of the following conditions are met: 
(a) the contract is related to the supply of goods or services, where the administrative 
procedures require certain controls related to the execution of the contract before 
the payment can be made; this applies in particular to factoring exposures or similar 
types of arrangements but does not apply to instruments such as bonds; 
(b) apart from the delay in payment no other indications of unlikeliness to pay as 
specified in accordance with Article 178(1)(a) and 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013 and these guidelines apply, the financial situation of the obligor is sound 
and there are no reasonable concerns that the obligation might not be paid in full, 
including any overdue interest where relevant; 
(c) the obligation is past due not longer than 180 days."|218
1249|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 26|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Exposures to central governments, local authorities and public|"26. Institutions that decide to apply the specific treatment referred to in paragraph 25 should 
apply all of the following: 
(a) these exposures should not be included in the calculation of the materiality threshold 
for other exposures to this obligor; 
(b) they should not be considered as defaults in the sense of Article 178 of Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013; 
(c) they should be clearly documented as exposures subject to the specific treatment."|118
1250|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 27|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Specific provisions applicable to factoring and purchased|"27. Where there are factoring arrangements whereby the ceded receivables are not recognised 
on the balance sheet of the factor and the factor is liable directly to the client up to a certain 
agreed percentage, the counting of days past due should commence from when the factoring 
account is in debit, i.e. from when the advances paid for the receivables exceed the 
percentage agreed between the factor and the client. For the purpose of determining items of 
the client of a factor that are past due, institutions should apply both of the following: 
(a) compare the sum of the amount of the factoring account that is in debit and all other 
past due obligations of the client recorded in the balance sheet of the factor, against 
the absolute component of the materiality threshold set by the competent authority 
in accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; 
(b) compare the relation between the sum described in point (a) and the total amount of 
current value of the factoring account, i.e. the value of advances paid for the 
receivables and all other on-balance sheet exposures related with the credit 
obligations of the client, against the relative component of the materiality threshold 
set by the competent authority in accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."|318
1251|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 28|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Specific provisions applicable to factoring and purchased|"28. Where there are factoring arrangements where the purchased receivables are recognised on 
the balance sheet of the factor and the factor has exposures to the debtors of the client, the 
counting of days past due should commence when the payment for a single receivable 
becomes due. In this situation, for institutions that use the IRB Approach, by virtue of the fact 
that the ceded receivables are purchased receivables, where they meet the requirements of 
154(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or in the case of purchased corporate receivables the 
requirements of Article 153(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the default definition may be 
applied as for retail exposures in accordance with Section 9 of these guidelines."|187
1252|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 29|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Specific provisions applicable to factoring and purchased|"29. Where the institution recognises events related to dilution risk of purchased receivables as 
defined in point (53) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, these events should not 
be considered as leading to the default of the obligor. Where the amount of receivable has 
been reduced as a result of events related to dilution risk such as discounts, deductions, 
netting or credit notes issued by the seller the reduced amount of receivable should be 
included in the calculation of days past due. Where there is a dispute between the obligor and 
the seller and such event is recognised as related to dilution risk the counting of days past due 
should be suspended until the dispute is resolved."|175
1253|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 30|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Specific provisions applicable to factoring and purchased|"30. Events recognised as related to dilution risk and hence excluded from the identification of 
default should be included in the calculation of own funds requirements or internal capital for 
dilution risk. Where institutions recognise significant number of events related to dilution risk, 
they should analyse and document the reasons for such events and assess the possible 
indications of unlikeliness to pay, in accordance with Articles 178(1) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 
No 575/2013 and Section 5 of these guidelines."|129
1254|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 31|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Specific provisions applicable to factoring and purchased|"31. Where the obligor has not been adequately informed about the cession of the receivable by 
the factor’s client and the institution has evidence that the payment for the receivable has 
been made to the client, the institution should not consider the receivable to be past due. 
Where the obligor has been adequately informed about the cession of the receivable but has 
nevertheless made the payment to the client, the institution should continue counting the 
days past due according to the conditions of the receivable."|125
1255|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 32|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Specific provisions applicable to factoring and purchased|"32. In the specific case of undisclosed factoring arrangements, where the obligors are not 
informed about the cession of the receivables but the purchased receivables are recognised 
on the balance sheet of the factor, the counting of days past due should commence from the 
moment agreed with the client when the payments made by the obligors should be 
transferred from the client to the factor."|102
1256|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 33|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Setting the materiality threshold|"33. Competent authorities should notify the EBA of the levels of the materiality thresholds that 
they set in their respective jurisdiction in accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. After the entry into force of the regulatory technical standards 
developed in accordance with Article 178(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, where 
competent authorities set the relative component of the materiality threshold at a level 
different than the 1% referred to in those regulatory technical standards, they should provide 
the justification for this different level of the threshold to the EBA."|154
1257|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 34|Definition of Default|4 Past due criterion in the identification of default > Setting the materiality threshold|"34. Institutions should apply the materiality threshold for past due credit obligations set by their 
competent authorities as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013. Institutions may identify defaults on the basis of a lower threshold if they can 
demonstrate that this lower threshold is a relevant indication of unlikeliness to pay and does 
not lead to an excessive number of defaults that return to non-defaulted status shortly after 
being recognised as defaulted or decrease of capital requirements. In this case institutions 
should record in their databases the information on the trigger of default as an additional 
specified indication of unlikeliness to pay."|157
1258|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 35|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Non-accrued status|"35. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (a) of Article 178(3) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should consider that an obligor is unlikely to pay 
where interest related to credit obligations is no longer recognised in the income statement 
of the institution due to the decrease of the credit quality of the obligation."|100
1259|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 36|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Specific credit risk adjustments (SCRA)|"36. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (b) of Article 178(3) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, all of the following specific credit risk adjustments (SCRA) 
should be considered to be a result of a significant perceived decline in the credit quality of a 
credit obligation and hence should be treated as an indication of unlikeliness to pay: 
(a) losses recognised in the profit or loss account for instruments measured at fair value 
that represent credit risk impairment under the applicable accounting framework; 
(b) losses as a result of current or past events affecting a significant individual exposure 
or exposures that are not individually significant which are individually or collectively 
assessed."|172
1260|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 37|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Specific credit risk adjustments (SCRA)|"37. The SCRA that cover the losses for which historical experience, adjusted on the basis of 
current observable data, indicate that the loss has occurred but the institution is not yet 
aware which individual exposure has suffered these losses (‘incurred but not reported 
losses’), should not be considered an indication of unlikeliness to pay of a specific obligor. 
38. Where the institution treats an exposure as impaired such a situation should be considered an 
additional indication of unlikeliness to pay and hence the obligor should be considered 
defaulted regardless of whether there are any SCRA assigned to this exposure. Where in 
accordance with the applicable accounting framework in the case of incurred but not 
reported losses exposures are recognised as impaired, these situations should not be treated 
as an indication of unlikeliness to pay."|190

defaulted regardless of whether there are any SCRA assigned to this exposure. Where in 
accordance with the applicable accounting framework in the case of incurred but not 
reported losses exposures are recognised as impaired, these situations should not be treated 
as an indication of unlikeliness to pay."|114

Where the institution treats an exposure as credit-impaired under IFRS 9, i.e. assigns it to 
Stage 3 as defined in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, published by the IASB in July 2014, such 
exposure should be considered defaulted, except where the exposure has been considered 
credit-impaired due to the delay in payment and either or both of the following conditions 
are met: 
(a) the competent authorities have replaced the 90 days past due with 180 days past due 
in accordance with point (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation EU (No) 575/2013 and this 
longer period is not used for the purpose of recognition of credit-impairment; 
(b) the materiality threshold referred to in Article 178(2)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013 has not been breached; 
(c) the exposure has been recognised as a technical past due situation in accordance with 
paragraph 23; 
(d) the exposure meets the conditions of paragraph 25."|246

Where the institution uses both IFRS 9 and another accounting framework it should choose 
whether to classify exposures as defaulted in accordance with paragraphs 36 to 38 or in 
accordance with paragraph 39. Once this choice is made it should be applied consistently over 
time."|80
1264|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 41|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Sale of the credit obligation|"41. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (c) of Article 178(3) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should take into account both the character and 
materiality of the loss related to the sale of credit obligations, in accordance with the 
following paragraphs. Transactions of traditional securitisation with significant risk transfer 
and any intragroup sales of credit obligations should be considered sale of credit obligations."|117
1265|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 42|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Sale of the credit obligation|"42. Institutions should analyse the reasons for the sale of credit obligations and the reasons for 
any losses recognised thereby. Where the reasons for the sale of credit obligations were not 
related to credit risk, such as where there is the need to increase the liquidity of the 
institution or there is a change in business strategy, and the institution does not perceive the 
credit quality of those obligations as declined, the economic loss related with the sale of 
those obligations should be considered not credit-related. In that case the sale should not be 
considered an indication of default even where the loss is material, on condition of the 
appropriate, documented justification of the treatment of the sale loss as not credit-related. 
Institutions may, in particular, consider the loss on the sale of credit obligations as non-credit 
related where the assets subject to the sale are publicly traded assets and measured at fair 
value."|199
1266|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 43|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Sale of the credit obligation|"43. Where, however, the loss on the sale of credit obligations is related to the credit quality of 
the obligations themselves, in particular where the institution sells the credit obligations due 
to the decrease in their quality, the institution should analyse the materiality of the economic 
loss and, where the economic loss is material, this should be considered an indication of 
default."|92
1267|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 44|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Sale of the credit obligation|"44. Institutions should set a threshold for the credit-related economic loss related with the sale of 
credit obligations to be considered material, which should be calculated according to the 
following formula, and should not be higher than 5%: 
See ""Economic_loss_equation"""|73
1268|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 45|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Sale of the credit obligation|"45. In order to assess the materiality of the overall economic loss related with the sale of credit 
obligations, institutions should calculate the economic loss and compare it to the threshold 
referred to in paragraph 44. Where the economic loss is higher than this threshold they 
should consider the credit obligations defaulted."|81
1269|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 46|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Sale of the credit obligation|"46. The sale of credit obligations may be performed either before or after the default. In the case 
of institutions that use the IRB Approach, regardless of the moment of the sale, if the sale was 
related with a material credit-related economic loss, the information about the loss should be 
adequately recorded and stored for the purpose of the estimation of risk parameters."|93
1270|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 47|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Sale of the credit obligation|"47. If the sale of a credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss occurred before the 
identification of default on that exposure, the moment of sale should be considered the 
moment of default. In the case of a partial sale of the total obligations of an obligor where the 
sale is associated to a material credit-related economic loss, all the remaining exposures to 
this obligor should be treated as defaulted, unless the exposures are eligible as retail 
exposures and the institution applies the default definition at facility level."|123
1271|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 48|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Sale of the credit obligation|"48. In the case of a sale of a portfolio of exposures the treatment of individual credit obligations 
within this portfolio should be determined in accordance with the manner the price for the 
portfolio was set. Where the price for the total portfolio was determined by specifying the 
discount on particular credit obligations, the materiality of credit-related economic loss 
should be assessed individually for each exposure within the portfolio. Where however the 
price was set only at the portfolio level, the materiality of credit-related economic loss may be 
assessed at the portfolio level and in that case, if the threshold specified in paragraph 44 is 
breached, all credit obligations within this portfolio should be treated as defaulted at the 
moment of the sale."|163
1272|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 49|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Distressed restructuring|"49. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a distressed restructuring should be considered to have 
occurred when concessions have been extended towards a debtor facing or about to face 
difficulties in meeting its financial commitments as specified in paragraphs 163-167 and 172-
174 of Annex V Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 as

Given that, as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the 
obligor should be considered defaulted where the distressed restructuring is likely to result in 
a diminished financial obligation, where considering forborne exposures, the obligor should 
be classified as defaulted only where the relevant forbearance measures are likely to result in 
a diminished financial obligation."|105
1274|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 51|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Distressed restructuring|"51. Institutions should set a threshold for the diminished financial obligation that is considered to 
be caused by material forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, or fees, and which 
should be calculated according to the following formula, and should not be higher than 1%: 
See ""Diminished_obligation_equation)"|81
1275|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 52|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Distressed restructuring|"52. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, for each distressed restructuring, institutions should calculate 
the diminished financial obligation and compare it with the threshold referred to in paragraph 51. 
Where the diminished financial obligation is higher than this threshold, the exposures 
should be considered defaulted."|101
1276|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 53|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Distressed restructuring|"53. If however the diminished financial obligation is below the specified threshold, and in 
particular when the net present value of expected cash flows based on the distressed 
restructuring arrangement is higher than the net present value of expected cash flows before 
the changes in terms and conditions, institutions should assess such exposures for other 
possible indications of unlikeliness to pay. Where the institution has reasonable doubts with 
regard to the likeliness of repayment in full of the obligation according to the new 
arrangement in a timely manner, the obligor should be considered defaulted. The indicators 
that may suggest unlikeliness to pay include the following: 
(a) a large lumpsum payment envisaged at the end of the repayment schedule; 
(b) irregular repayment schedule where significantly lower payments are envisaged at 
the beginning of repayment schedule; 
(c) significant grace period at the beginning of the repayment schedule; 
(d) the exposures to the obligor have been subject to distressed restructuring more than 
once."|217
1277|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 54|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Distressed restructuring|"54. Any concession extended to an obligor already in default, should lead to classify the obligor as 
a distressed restructuring. All exposures classified as forborne non-performing in accordance 
with Annex V of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 as 
amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/227 should be classified as

Where any of the modifications of the schedule of credit obligations referred to in point (e) of 
Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is the result of financial difficulties of an 
obligor, institutions should also assess whether a distressed restructuring has taken place and 
whether an indication of unlikeliness to pay has occurred."|92
1279|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 56|Definition of Default|5 Indications of unlikeliness to pay > Bankruptcy|"56. For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (e) and (f) of Article 178(3) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should clearly specify in their internal policies what 
type of arrangement is treated as an order or as a protection similar to bankruptcy, taking 
into account all relevant legal frameworks as well as the following typical characteristics of 
such protection: 
(a) the protection scheme encompasses all creditors or all creditors with unsecured 
claims; 
(b) the terms and conditions of the protection scheme are approved by the court or other 
relevant public authority; 
(c) the terms and conditions of the protection scheme include a temporary suspension of 
payments or partial redemption of debt; 
(d) the measures involve some sort of control over the management of the company and 
its assets; 
(e) if the protection scheme fails, the company is likely to be liquidated."|208

Institutions should specify in their internal policies and procedures other additional 
indications of unlikeliness to pay of an obligor, besides those specified in Article 178(3) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Those additional indications should be specified per type of 
exposures, as defined in point (2) of Article 142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, reflecting 
their specificities, and they should be specified for all business lines, legal entities or 
geographical locations. The occurrence of an additional indication of unlikeliness to pay 
should either result in an automatic reclassification to defaulted exposures or trigger a case-
by-case assessment and may include indications based on internal or external information."|178

The possible indications of unlikeliness to pay that could be considered by institutions on the 
basis of internal information include the following: 
(a) a borrower’s sources of recurring income are no longer available to meet the 
payments of instalments; 
(b) there are justified concerns about a borrower’s future ability to generate stable and 
sufficient cash flows; 
(c) the borrower’s overall leverage level has significantly increased or there are justified 
expectations of such changes to leverage; 
(d) the borrower has breached the covenants of a credit contract; 
(e) the institution has called any collateral including a guarantee; 
(f) for the exposures to an individual: default of a company fully owned by a single 
individual where this individual provided the institution with a personal guarantee for 
all obligations of a company; 
(g) for retail exposures where the default definition is applied at the level of an individual 
credit facility, the fact that a significant part of the total obligation of the obligor is in 
default; 
(h) the reporting of an exposure as non-performing in accordance with Annex V of 
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014 as amended 
by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/227, except where competent

Institutions should also take into account the information available in external databases, 
including credit registers, macroeconomic indicators and public information sources, including 
press articles and financial analyst’s reports. The indications of unlikeliness to pay that could 
be considered by institutions on the basis of external information include the following: 
(a) significant delays in payments to other creditors have been recorded in the relevant 
credit register; 
(b) a crisis of the sector in which the counterparty operates combined with a weak 
position of the counterparty in this sector; 
(c) disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of the financial 
difficulties of the debtor; 
(d) an institution has information that a third party, in particular another institution, has 
filed for bankruptcy or similar protection of the obligor."|186

When specifying the criteria for unlikeliness to pay, institutions should take into consideration 
the relations within the groups of connected clients as defined in point 39 of Article 4(1) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In particular institutions should specify in their internal policies 
when the default of one obligor within the group of connected clients has a contagious effect 
on other entities within this group. Such specifications should be in line with the appropriate 
policies for the assignment of exposures to individual obligor to an obligor grade and to 
groups of connected clients in accordance with point (d) of Article 172(1) of Regulation (EU) 
No 575/2013. Where such criteria have not been specified for a non-standard situation, in the 
case of default of an obligor that is part of a group of connected clients, institutions should 
assess the potential unlikeliness to pay of all other entities within this group on a case-by-case 
basis."|229

Where a financial asset was purchased or originated by an institution at a material discount 
institutions should assess whether that discount reflects the deteriorated credit quality of the 
obligor and whether there are any indications of default in accordance with these guidelines. 
The assessment of unlikeliness to pay should refer to the total amount owed by the obligor 
regardless of the price that the institution has paid for the asset. This assessment may be 
based on the due diligence performed before the purchase of the asset or on the analysis 
performed for the accounting purposes in order to determine whether the asset is credit-
impaired."|147

Institutions should have adequate policies and procedures to identify credit frauds. Typically 
when credit fraud is identified, the exposure is already defaulted on the basis of material 
delays in payment. However, if the credit fraud is identified before default has been 
recognised this should be treated as an additional indication of unlikeliness to pay."|89

Institutions should establish policies regarding the definition of default in order to ensure its 
consistent and effective application and in particular they should have clear policies and 
procedures on the application of the criteria for unlikeliness to pay as laid down in Article 
178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and all other indications of unlikeliness to pay as 
specified by the institution, covering all types of exposures as defined in point (2) of Article

With regard to each indication of unlikeliness to pay institutions should define the adequate 
methods of their identification, including the sources of information and frequency of 
monitoring. The sources of information should include both internal and external sources, 
including in particular relevant external databases and registers."|78
1289|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 66|Definition of Default|6 Application of the definition of default in external data|"66. Institutions that use the IRB Approach and use external data for the purpose of estimation of

For the purposes of Article 178(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should do all of 
the following: 
(a) verify whether the definition of default used in the external data is in line with Article 
178 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013; 
(b) verify whether the definition of default used in external data is consistent with the 
definition of default as implemented by the institution for the relevant portfolio of 
exposures, including in particular: the counting and number of days past due that 
triggers default, the structure and level of materiality threshold for past due credit 
obligations, the definition of distressed restructuring that triggers default, the type 
and level of specific credit risk adjustments that triggers default and the criteria to 
return to non-defaulted status; 
(c) document sources of external data, the default definition used in external data, the 
performed analysis and all identified differences."|207

For each difference identified in the definition of default resulting from the assessment of 
paragraph 67, institutions should do all of the following: 
(a) assess whether the adjustment to the internal definition of default would lead to an 
increased or a decreased default rate or whether it is impossible to determine; 
(b) either perform appropriate adjustments in the external data or be able to 
demonstrate that the difference is negligible in terms of the impact on all risk 
parameters and own funds requirements,"|112
1292|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 69|Definition of Default|6 Application of the definition of default in external data|"69. Regarding the totality of the differences identified in the definition of default resulting from 
the assessment of paragraph 67 and taking into account the adjustments performed in 
accordance with point (b) of paragraph 68, institutions should be able to demonstrate to 
competent authorities that broad equivalence with the internal definition of default has been 
achieved, including, where possible by comparing the default rate in internal data on a 
relevant type of exposures with external data."|106
1293|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 70|Definition of Default|6 Application of the definition of default in external data|"70. Where the assessment of paragraph 67 identifies differences in the definition of default 
which the process of paragraph 68 reveals to be non-negligible but not possible to overcome 
by adjustments in the external data, institutions are required to adopt an appropriate margin 
of conservatism in the estimation of risk parameters as referred to in Article 179(1)(f) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In that case institutions should ensure that this additional 
margin of conservatism reflects the materiality of the remaining differences in the definition 
of default and their possible impact on all risk parameters."|135

For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, except for 
situations referred to in paragraph 72, institutions should apply all of the following: 
(a) consider that no trigger of default continues to apply to a previously defaulted 
exposure, where at least 3 months have passed since the moment that the conditions 
referred to in Articles 178(1)(b) and 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 cease to 
be met; 
(b) take into account the behaviour of the obligor during the period referred to in point 
(a); 
(c) take into account the financial situation of the obligor during the period referred to in 
point (a); 
(d) after the period referred to in point (a), perform an assessment, and, where the 
institution still finds that the obligor is unlikely to pay its obligations in full without 
recourse to realising security, the exposures should continue to be classified as 
defaulted until the institution is satisfied that the improvement of the credit quality is 
factual and permanent; 
(e) the conditions referred to in points (a) to (d) should be met also with regard to new 
exposures to the obligor, in particular where the previous defaulted exposures to this 
obligor were sold or written off. 
Institutions may apply the period referred to in point (a) to all exposures or apply different 
periods for different types of exposures."|344

For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, and where 
distressed restructuring according to paragraph 49 of these guidelines applies to a defaulted 
exposure, regardless of whether such restructuring was carried out before or after the 
identification of default, institutions should consider that no trigger of default continues to 
apply to a previously defaulted exposure, where at least 1 year has passed from the latest 
between one of the following events: 
(a) the moment of extending the restructuring measures; 
(b) the moment when the exposure has been classified as defaulted; 
(c) the end of the grace period included in the restructuring arrangements."|166

Institutions should reclassify the exposure to a non-defaulted status after at least the one 
year period referred to in the previous paragraph, where all of the following conditions are 
met: 
(a) during that period a material payment has been made by the obligor; material 
payment may be considered to be made where the debtor has paid, via its regular 
payments in accordance with the restructuring arrangements, a total equal to the 
amount that was previously past-due (if there were past-due amounts) or that has 
been written-off (if there were no past-due amounts) under the restructuring 
measures; 
(b) during that period the payments have been made regularly according to the schedule 
applicable after the restructuring arrangements; 
(c) there are no past due credit obligations according to the schedule applicable after the 
restructuring arrangements; 
(d) no indications of unlikeliness to pay as specified in Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013 or any additional indications of unlikeliness to pay specified by the 
institution apply; 
(e) the institution does not consider it otherwise unlikely that the obligor will pay its credit 
obligations in full according to the schedule after the restructuring arrangements 
without recourse to realising security. In this assessment institutions should examine 
in particular situations where a large lumpsum payment or significantly larger 
payments are envisaged at the end of the repayment schedule; 
(f) the conditions referred to in points (a) to (e) should be met also with regard to new 
exposures to the obligor, in particular where the previous defaulted exposures to this

For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, an 
institution should define clear criteria and policies regarding when the obligor can be 
classified back to non-defaulted status and more in particular, both of the following: 
(a) when it can be considered that the improvement of the financial situation of an 
obligor is sufficient to allow the full and timely repayment of the credit obligation; 
(b) when the repayment is actually likely to be made even where there is an 
improvement in the financial situation of an obligor in accordance with point (a)."|151

Institutions should monitor on a regular basis the effectiveness of their policies mentioned in 
paragraph 75, and in particular monitor and analyse: 
(a) the changes of status of the obligors or facilities; 
(b) the impact of the adopted policies on cure rates; 
(c) the impact of adopted policies on multiple defaults."|87

It is expected that the institution would have a limited number of obligors who default soon 
after returning to a non-defaulted status. In the case of extensive number of multiple defaults 
the institution should revise its policies with regard to the reclassification of exposures."|74
1301|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 78|Definition of Default|7 Criteria for the return to a non-defaulted status > Monitoring of the effectiveness of the policy|"78. The analysis of the changes in statuses of the obligors or facilities should in particular be 
taken into account for the purpose of specifying the periods referred to in paragraphs 71 and 72. 
Institutions may specify longer periods for the exposures that have been classified as 
defaulted in the preceding 24 months."|85
1302|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 79|Definition of Default|8 Consistency in the application of the definition of default > Overview|"79. Institutions should adopt adequate mechanisms and procedures in order to ensure that the 
definition of default is implemented and used in a correct manner, and should, in particular, 
ensure: 
(a) that default of a single obligor is identified consistently across the institution with 
regard to all exposures to this obligor in all relevant IT systems, including in all the 
legal entities within the group and in all geographical locations in accordance with 
paragraphs 80 to 82 or for retail exposures in accordance with paragraphs 92 to 94; 
(b) that one of the following applies: 
i. the same definition of default is used consistently by an institution, parent 
undertaking or any of its subsidiaries and across the types of exposures; 
ii. where different definitions of default apply either within a group or across 
the types of exposures, the scope of application of each of the default 
definitions is clearly specified, in accordance with paragraphs 83 to 85;"|212
1303|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 80|Definition of Default|8 Consistency in the application of the definition of default > Consistent identification of default of a single obligor|"80. For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 79, institutions should implement adequate 
procedures and mechanisms to ensure that the default of a single obligor is identified 
consistently across the institution with regard to all exposures to this obligor in all relevant IT 
systems, including in all the legal entities within the group and in all geographical locations 
where it is active in ways other than via a legal entity."|110
1304|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 81|Definition of Default|8 Consistency in the application of the definition of default > Consistent identification of default of a single obligor|"81. Where the exchange of client data among different legal entities within an institution, the 
parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries is prohibited by consumer protection regulations, 
bank secrecy or other legislation resulting in inconsistencies in the identification of default of 
an obligor, institutions should inform their competent authorities of these legal impediments 
and, if they use the IRB Approach they should also estimate the materiality of the 
inconsistencies in the identification of default of an obligor and their possible impact on the 
estimates of risk parameters."|132
1305|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 82|Definition of Default|8 Consistency in the application of the definition of default > Consistent identification of default of a single obligor|"82. Further, where the identification of default of an obligor in a manner fully consistent across 
the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries is very burdensome, requiring 
development of a centralised database of all clients or implementation of other mechanisms 
or procedures to verify the status of each client at all entities within the group, institutions 
need not apply such mechanisms or procedures if they can demonstrate that the effect of 
non-compliance is immaterial because there are no or very limited number of common clients 
among the relevant entities within a group and the exposure to these clients is immaterial."|145
1306|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 83|Definition of Default|8 Consistency in the application of the definition of default > Consistent use of the definition of default across types of|"83. For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 79, an institution, parent undertaking or any of its 
subsidiaries should use the same definition of default for a single type of exposures as defined 
in point (2) of Article 142(1) pf Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. They may use different 
definitions of default for different types of exposures, including for certain legal entities or for 
presence in geographical locations in ways other than via a legal entity, where this is justified 
by the application of significantly different internal risk management practices or by different 
legal requirements applying in different jurisdictions, in particular by reasons such as: 
(a) different materiality thresholds set by competent authorities in their jurisdictions in 
accordance with point (d) of Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; 
(b) the use of 180 days instead of 90 days past due for certain types of exposures to 
which the IRB Approach is applied in some jurisdictions in accordance with point (b) 
of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; 
(c) the specification of additional indications of unlikeliness to pay specific for certain 
legal entities, geographical locations or types of exposures."|291
1307|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 84|Definition of Default|8 Consistency in the application of the definition of default > Consistent use of the definition of default across types of|"84. For the purposes of point (b)(ii) of paragraph 79, and where different definitions of default 
are applied either across types of exposures in accordance with paragraph 83, the 
institutions’ internal procedures relating to the definition of default should ensure both of the 
following: 
(a) that the scope of application of each definition is clearly specified; 
(b) that the definition of default specified for a certain type of exposures, legal entity or 
geographical location is applied consistently to all exposures within the scope of 
application of each relevant definition of default."|140
1308|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 85|Definition of Default|8 Consistency in the application of the definition of default > Consistent use of the definition of default across types of|"85. Further, for institutions that use the IRB Approach, the use of different default definitions has 
to be adequately reflected in the estimation of risk parameters in the case of ratings systems 
which scope of application encompasses different default definitions."|71
1309|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 86|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Level of application of the default definition for retail exposures|"86. According to the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, in 
the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default at the level of an 
individual credit facility rather than in relation to the total obligations of a borrower. 
Therefore, institutions that use the IRB Approach, in particular, may apply the definition of 
default at the level of the individual facility for retail exposures as defined in Article 147(5) of 
Regulation (EU) 575/2013. Institutions that use the Standardised Approach, instead may apply 
the definition of default at the level of an individual credit facility for all exposures that meet 
the criteria specified in Article 123 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, even where some of those 
exposures have been assigned to a different exposure class for the purpose of assigning a risk 
weight, such as exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property."|225
1310|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 87|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Level of application of the default definition for retail exposures|"87. Institutions should choose the level of application of the definition of default between obligor 
and facility for all retail exposures in a way that reflects their internal risk management 
practices."|59
1311|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 88|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Level of application of the default definition for retail exposures|"88. Institutions may apply the definition of default at the level of an obligor for some types of 
retail exposures and at the level of a credit facility for others, where this is well justified by 
internal risk management practices, for instance due to a different business model of a 
subsidiary, and where there is evidence that the number of situations where the same clients 
are subject to different definitions of default at different levels of application is kept to a strict 
minimum."|119
1312|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 89|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Level of application of the default definition for retail exposures|"89. Where institutions decide to use different levels of application of the definition of default for 
different types of retail exposures, according to paragraph 88, they should ensure that the 
scope of application of each definition of default is clearly specified and that it is used 
consistently over time for different types of retail exposures. In the case of institutions that 
use the IRB Approach the risk estimates should correctly reflect the definition of default 
applied to each type of exposures."|118
1313|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 90|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Level of application of the default definition for retail exposures|"90. Where institutions use different levels of application of the default definition with regard to 
certain retail portfolios, the treatment of common clients across such portfolios should be 
specified in their internal policies and procedures. In particular, where the exposure to which 
the definition of default at the obligor level applies fulfils either or both of the conditions of 
points (a) or (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, then all exposures to that 
obligor should be considered defaulted, including those subject to the application of the 
definition of default at individual credit facility level. Where the exposure subject to the 
application of the definition of default at individual credit facility level meets those 
conditions, the other exposures to the obligor should not be automatically reclassified to 
default status. Institutions, however, may classify those other exposures as defaulted on the 
basis of other unlikeliness to pay considerations, as provided further in paragraphs 92 to 94."|228
1314|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 91|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Level of application of the default definition for retail exposures|"91. The same rule should apply to the obligors treated under the Standardised Approach, where 
some exposures to an obligor fulfil the requirements of Article 123 of Regulation (EU) 
575/2013 while other exposures to the same obligor are in the form of securities and 
therefore do not qualify as retail. Where an exposure in the form of a security fulfils either or 
both of the conditions of points (a) or (b) of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, all 
exposures to that obligor should be considered defaulted. Where the exposure that fulfils the 
requirements of Article 123 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 meets those conditions and the 
institution applies the definition of default at the individual credit facility level, the other 
exposures to the obligor should not be automatically reclassified to default status. 
Institutions, however, may classify those other exposures as defaulted on the basis of other 
unlikeliness to pay considerations, as provided further in paragraphs 92 to 94."|250
1315|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 92|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"92. Where, in accordance with the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013, the definition of default has been applied at the level of an individual credit facility 
with regard to retail exposures, institutions should not consider automatically the different 
exposures to the same obligor defaulted at the same time. Nevertheless institutions should 
take into account that some indications of default are related with the condition of the 
obligor rather than the status of a particular exposure. This refers in particular to the 
indications of unlikeliness to pay related with the bankruptcy of the obligor as specified in 
points (e) and (f) of Article 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Where such indication of 
default occurs, institutions should treat all exposures to the same obligor as defaulted 
regardless of the level of application of the definition of default."|218
1316|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 93|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"93. Institutions should consider also other indications of unlikeliness to pay and specify, in line 
with their internal policies and procedures, which indications of unlikeliness to pay reflect the 
overall situation of an obligor rather than that of the exposure. Where such other indications 
of unlikeliness to pay occur, all exposures to the obligor should be considered defaulted 
regardless of the level of application of the definition of default."|111
1317|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 94|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"94. Additionally, where a significant part of the exposures to the obligor is in default, institutions 
may consider it unlikely that the other obligations of that obligor will be paid in full without 
recourse to actions such as realising security and treat them as defaulted as well."|80
1318|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 95|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"95. The application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the obligor level implies 
that, where any credit obligation of the obligor meets the conditions of points (a) or (b) or 
both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, then all exposures to that obligor 
should be considered defaulted. Institutions that decide to apply the definition of default for 
retail exposures at the obligor level should specify detailed rules for the treatment of joint 
credit obligations and default contagion between exposures in their internal policies and 
procedures."|145
1319|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 96|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"96. Institutions should consider a joint credit obligation as an exposure to two or more obligors 
that are equally responsible for the repayment of the credit obligation. This notion does not 
extend to a credit obligation of an individual obligor secured by another individual or entity in 
the form of a guarantee or other credit protection."|87
1320|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 97|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"97. Where the conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013 are met with regard to a joint credit obligation of two or more obligors, institutions 
should consider all other joint credit obligations of the same set of obligors and all individual 
exposures to those obligors as defaulted, unless they can justify that the recognition of 
default on individual exposures is not appropriate because at least one of the following 
conditions apply: 
(a) the delay in payment of a joint credit obligation results from a dispute between the 
individual obligors participating in the joint credit obligation that has been introduced 
to a court or another formal procedure performed by a dedicated external body that 
results in a binding ruling in accordance with the applicable legal framework in the 
relevant jurisdiction, and there is no concern about the financial situation of the 
individual obligors; 
(b) a joint credit obligation is an immaterial part of the total obligations of an individual 
obligor."|236
1321|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 98|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"98. The default of a joint credit obligation should not cause the default of other joint credit 
obligations of individual obligors with other individuals or entities, which are not involved in 
the credit obligation that has initially been defaulted; however, institutions should assess 
whether the default of the joint credit obligation at hand constitutes an indication of 
unlikeliness to pay with regard to the other joint credit obligations."|105
1322|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 99|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"99. Where the conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013 are met with regard to the credit obligation of an individual obligor, the contagious 
effect of this default should not automatically spread to any joint credit obligations of that 
obligor; nevertheless, institutions should assess such joint credit obligations for possible 
indications of unlikeliness to pay related with the default of one of the obligors. In any case, 
where all individual obligors have a defaulted status, their joint credit obligation should 
automatically also be considered defaulted."|153
1323|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 100|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"100. Institutions should identify, on the basis of the analysis of relevant legal provisions in a 
jurisdiction, and provide in their internal policies and procedures for the identification of the 
obligors that are legally fully liable for certain obligations jointly and severally with other 
obligors, therefore being fully liable for the entire amount of those obligations, but excluding 
credit obligations of an individual obligor secured by another individual or entity in the form 
of a guarantee or other credit protection. A typical example would be a married couple 
where, based on specific legal provisions applicable in the relevant jurisdiction, division of 
marital property (system of separate estates) does not apply. In the case of full mutual 
liability for all obligations, default of one of such obligors should be considered an indication 
of potential unlikeliness to pay of the other obligor and therefore institutions should assess 
whether the individual and joint credit obligations of these obligors should be considered 
defaulted. Where one of the joint and several obligors that are legally fully liable for all 
obligations, has a joint credit obligation with another client, the institution should assess 
whether indications of unlikeliness to pay occur also on the other joint credit obligations with 
third parties."|277
1324|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 101|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"101. Institutions should also analyse the forms of legal entities in relevant jurisdictions and the 
extent of liability of the owners, partners, shareholders or managers for the obligations of a 
company depending on the legal form of the entity. Where an individual is fully liable for the 
obligations of a company, default of that company should result in that individual being 
considered defaulted as well. Where such full liability for the obligations of a company does 
not exist, owners, partners or significant shareholders of a defaulted company should be 
assessed by the institution for possible indications of unlikeliness to pay with regard to their 
individual obligations."|151
1325|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 102|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"102. Additionally, in the specific case of an individual entrepreneur where an individual is fully 
liable for both private and commercial obligations with both private and commercial assets 
the default of any of the private or commercial obligations should cause all private and 
commercial obligations of such individual to be considered as defaulted as well."|84

Where the definition of default is applied at the level of an obligor for retail exposures, 
the materiality threshold should also be applied at the level of an obligor. Institutions should 
clearly specify in their internal policies and procedures the treatment of joint credit 
obligations in the application of the materiality threshold."|90
1327|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 104|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"104. A joint obligor, i.e. a specific set of individual obligors that have a joint obligation towards 
an institution, should be treated as a different obligor from each of the individual obligors. In 
the case the delay in payment occurs on a joint credit obligation, the materiality of such delay 
should be assessed by applying the materiality threshold referred to in point (d) of Article 
178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to all joint credit obligations granted to this specific 
set of obligors. For this purpose the individual exposures to obligors participating in a joint 
credit obligation or to any other subsets of such obligors should not be taken into account. 
However, where the materiality threshold for a joint obligor calculated in this way is 
breached, all joint credit obligations of this set of obligors and all individual exposures to the 
obligors participating in a joint credit obligation should be considered defaulted unless any of 
the conditions specified in paragraph 97 is met."|235
1328|EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation(EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 105|Definition of Default|9 Application of the definition of default for retail exposures > Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the|"105. When delay in payment occurs on an individual credit obligation, the materiality of such 
delay should be assessed by applying the materiality threshold referred to in point (d) of 
Article 178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to all individual credit obligations of this 
obligor, without taking into account any joint credit obligations of that obligor with other 
individuals or entities. Where the materiality threshold calculated in this way is breached, all 
individual exposures to this obligor should be considered defaulted."|135

Institutions should have effective processes that allow them to obtain the relevant 
information in order to identify defaults in a timely manner, and to channel the relevant 
information in the shortest possible time and, where possible, in an automated manner, to 
the personnel that is responsible for taking credit decisions, and more in particular: 
(a) where they apply automatic processes, such as counting of days past due, the 
identification of indications of default should be performed on a daily basis; 
(b) where they implement manual processes, such as checking external sources and 
databases, analysis of watch lists, analysis of the lists of forborne exposures, 
identification of SCRA, the information should be updated with a frequency that 
guarantees the timely identification of default."|174

Institutions should verify on a regular basis that all forborne non-performing exposures 
are classified as default and subject to distressed restructuring. Institutions should also 
analyse on a regular basis the forborne performing exposures in order to determine whether 
any of them fulfils the indication of unlikeliness to pay as specified in Article 178(3)(d) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in paragraphs 49 to 55."|114

Control mechanisms should ensure that the relevant information is used in the default 
identification process immediately after being obtained. All exposures to a defaulted obligor 
or all relevant exposures in case of the application of the definition of default at the facility 
level for retail exposures should be marked as defaulted in all relevant IT systems without 
undue delay. If delays occur in the recording of the default, such delays should not lead to 
errors or inconsistencies in risk management, risk reporting, the own funds requirements 
calculation or the use of data in risk quantification. In particular it should be ensured that the 
internal and external reporting figures reflect a situation where all exposures are correctly 
classified."|156

Institutions should document their policies regarding the definition of default including all 
triggers for identification of default and the exit criteria as well as clear identification of the 
scope of application of the definition of default and, more in particular they should: 
(a) document the operationalisation of all indications of default; 
(b) document the operationalisation of the criteria for reclassification of a defaulted

(c) keep an updated register of all definitions of default."|114

For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 109, institutions should keep an updated 
register of all current and past versions of the default definition at least starting from the date 
of application of these guidelines. This register should include at least the following 
information: 
(a) the scope of application of the default definition, if there is more than one default 
definition used within the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its 
subsidiaries; 
(b) the body approving the definition or definitions of default and date of approval for 
each of those definitions of default; 
(c) the date of implementation of each definition of default; 
(d) brief description of all changes performed relatively to the last version;

Institutions that use the IRB Approach should adopt adequate mechanisms and 
procedures in order to ensure that the definition of default is implemented and used in a 
correct manner, and should in particular ensure that: 
(a) the definition of default and the scope of its application is what is required to be 
approved by the management body, or by a committee designated by it, and by 
senior management in accordance with Article 189(1) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013; 
(b) the definition of default is used consistently for the purpose of the own funds 
requirements calculation and plays a meaningful role in the internal risk management 
processes by being used at least in the area of monitoring of exposures and in the 
internal reporting to senior management and management body; 
(c) the internal audit unit or another comparable independent auditing unit reviews 
regularly the robustness and effectiveness of the process used by the institution for 
the identification of default, taking into account in particular the timeliness of the 
identification of default referred to in paragraphs 106 to 108; and ensuring that the 
conclusions of the internal audit’s review and respective recommendations, as well as 
the measures taken to remedy the identified weaknesses are communicated directly 
to the management body or the committee designated by it."|285

1349|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 12|Model application, use, review and changes|4 General estimation requirements > 4.1 Principles for specifying the range of application of the rating|"12. A rating system in the sense of point (1) of Article 142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 
should cover all those exposures where the obligors or facilities show common drivers of risk 
and credit-worthiness and fundamentally comparable availability of credit-related 
information. The PD and LGD model within a rating system may comprise various calibration 
segments. Where all obligors or exposures within the range of application of the PD or LGD 
model are jointly calibrated the whole scope of application of the model is considered one 
calibration segment."|139
1350|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 13|Model application, use, review and changes|4 General estimation requirements > 4.1 Principles for specifying the range of application of the rating|"13. Exposures covered by the same rating system should be treated similarly by the institution in 
terms of risk management, decision making and credit approval process and should be 
assigned to a common obligor rating scale for the purposes of Article 170(1)(b) of Regulation 
(EU) No 575/2013 and a common facility rating scale for the purposes of Article 170(1)(e) of 
that Regulation."|110
1351|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 14|Model application, use, review and changes|4 General estimation requirements > 4.1 Principles for specifying the range of application of the rating|"14. For the purpose of quantification of various risk parameters within a rating system, 
institutions should apply the same definition of default for the same historical observations 
used in different models. Institutions should also apply the same treatment of multiple 
defaults of the same obligor or exposure across internal, external and pooled data sources."|85
1352|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 15|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.1 Quality of data|"15. In order to comply with the requirement of Article 76 of the RTS on IRB assessment 
methodology that institutions should have sound policies, processes and methods for 
assessing and improving the quality of data used for the purpose of credit risk measurement 
and management processes, institutions should ensure that those policies apply to all data 
used in model development and calibration, as well as to the data used in the application of 
the risk parameters."|113
1353|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 16|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.1 Quality of data|"16. In order for the data used in the model development and in the application of risk parameters 
as inputs into the model to meet the requirements of accuracy, completeness and 
appropriateness specified in Article 174(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, it should be 
sufficiently precise to avoid material distortions of the outcome of the assignment of 
exposures to obligors or facility grades or pools, and it should not contain any biases which 
make the data unfit for purpose."|128
1354|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 17|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.2 Governance for data representativeness|"17. In order to comply with the requirement of the representativeness of data used in the PD and 
LGD models specified in Articles 174(c), 179(1)(d) and 179(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013 as well as in Articles 40 and 45 of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, 
institutions should have sound policies, processes and methods for assessing the 
representativeness of data used for the purpose of estimation of risk parameters. Institutions 
should specify in their internal policies the statistical tests and metrics to be used for the 
purpose of assessing the representativeness of data used for risk differentiation and, 
separately, for data underlying the risk quantification. Institutions should also specify 
methods for qualitative assessment of data for the cases, defined in their policies, where the 
application of statistical tests is not possible."|210
1355|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 18|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.2 Governance for data representativeness|"18. Institutions should use the same standards and methods for the assessment of 
representativeness of data stemming from different sources, including internal, external and 
pooled data or a combination of these, unless different methods are justified by the 
specificity of the data source or availability of information."|84
1356|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 19|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.2 Governance for data representativeness|"19. Where external or pooled data are used institutions should obtain sufficient information from 
the data providers to assess the representativeness of such external or pooled data to the 
institutions’ own portfolios and processes."|67
1357|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 20|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.3 Representativeness of data for model development|"20. Institutions should analyse the representativeness of data in the case of statistical models and 
other mechanical methods used to assign exposures to grades or pools, as well as in the case 
of statistical default prediction models generating default probability estimates for individual 
obligors or facilities. Institutions should select an appropriate dataset for the purpose of 
model development to ensure that the performance of the model on the application 
portfolio, in particular its discriminatory power, is not significantly hindered by insufficient 
representativeness of data."|130
1358|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 21|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.3 Representativeness of data for model development|"21. For the purposes of ensuring that the data used in developing the model for assigning obligors 
or exposures to grades or pools is representative of the application portfolio covered by the 
relevant model, as required in Article 174(c) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Article 40(2) 
of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology institutions should analyse the representativeness 
of the data at the stage of model development in terms of all of the following: 
(a) the scope of application; 
(b) the definition of default; 
(c) the distribution of the relevant risk characteristics; 
(d) lending standards and recovery policies."|162
1359|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 22|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.3 Representativeness of data for model development|"22. For the purpose of paragraph 21(a) institutions should analyse the segmentation of exposures 
and consider whether there were any changes to the scope of application of the considered 
model over the period covered by the data used in developing the model for assigning 
obligors or exposures to grades or pools. Where such changes were observed institutions 
should analyse the risk drivers relevant for the change of the scope of application of the 
model by comparing their distribution in the RDS before and after the change as well as with 
the distribution of those risk drivers in the application portfolio. For this purpose institutions 
should apply statistical methodologies such as cluster analysis or similar techniques to 
demonstrate representativeness. In the case of pooled models the analysis should be 
performed with regard to the part of the scope of the model that is used by an institution."|198
1360|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 23|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.3 Representativeness of data for model development|"23. For the purpose of paragraph 21(b) institutions should ensure that the definition of default 
underlying the data used for model development is consistent over time and, in particular, 
that it is consistent with all of the following: 
(a) that adjustments have been made to achieve consistency with the current default 
definition where the default definition has been changed during the observation period; 
(b) that adequate measures have been adopted by the institution, where the model covers 
exposures in several jurisdictions having or having had different default definitions; 
(c) that the definition of default in each data source has been analysed separately; 
(d) that the definition of default used for the purposes of model development does not have 
a negative impact on the structure and performance of the rating model, in terms of risk 
differentiation and predictive power, where this definition is different from the definition 
of default used by the institution in accordance with Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013."|229
1361|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 24|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.3 Representativeness of data for model development|"24. For the purpose of paragraph 21(c) institutions should analyse the distribution and range of 
values of key risk characteristics of the data used in developing the model for risk 
differentiation in comparison with the application portfolio. With regard to LGD models, 
institutions should perform such analysis separately for non-defaulted and defaulted 
exposures."|98
1362|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 25|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.3 Representativeness of data for model development|"25. Institutions should analyse the representativeness of the data in terms of the structure of the 
portfolio by relevant risk characteristics based on statistical tests specified in their policies to 
ensure that the range of values observed on these risk characteristics in the application 
portfolio is adequately reflected in the development sample. Where the application of 
statistical tests is not possible, institutions should carry out at least a qualitative analysis on the 
basis of the descriptive statistics of the structure of the portfolio, taking into account the 
possible seasoning effects referred to in Article 180(2)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. When 
considering the results of this analysis, institutions should take into account the sensitivity of 
the risk characteristics to economic conditions. Material differences in the key risk 
characteristics between the data sample and the application portfolio should be addressed, for 
example by using another data sample or a subset of observations or by adequately reflecting 
these risk characteristics as risk drivers in the model."|228
1363|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 26|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.3 Representativeness of data for model development|"26. For the purpose of paragraph 21(d) institutions should analyse whether, over the relevant 
historical observation period, there were significant changes in their lending standards or 
recovery policies or in the relevant legal environment, including changes in insolvency law, 
legal foreclosure procedures and any legal regulations related to realisation of collaterals, 
which may influence the level of risk or the distribution or ranges of the risk characteristics in 
the portfolio covered by the considered model. Where institutions observe such changes they 
should compare the data included in the RDS before and after the change of the policy. 
Institutions should ensure comparability of the current underwriting or recovery standards 
with those applied to the observations included in the RDS and used for model development."|181
1364|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 27|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.3 Representativeness of data for model development|"27. Within the PD model the representativeness of data used in developing the model for risk 
differentiation does not require that the proportion of defaulted and non-defaulted 
exposures in this dataset be equal to the proportion of defaulted and non-defaulted 
exposures in the institution’s application portfolio. However, institutions should have a 
sufficient number of defaulted and non-defaulted observations in the development dataset 
and they should document the difference."|119
1365|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 28|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.4 Representativeness of data for calibration of risk parameters|"28. In order for institutions to ensure that the data used in risk quantification is representative of 
the application portfolio covered by the relevant model in accordance with Sub-section 2 of 
Section 6 of Chapter 3 in Part Three of Regulation (EU) No 575/2031 and Article 45(2) of the 
RTS on IRB assessment methodology, institutions should analyse the comparability of the data 
used for the purpose of calculating long-run average default rates or long-run average LGDs 
as referred to in Article 179(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and, where relevant, the 
representativeness of the pool in accordance with Article 179(2)(b) of that Regulation, in 
terms of all of the following: 
(a) the scope of application; 
(b) the definition of default; 
(c) the distribution of the relevant risk characteristics; 
(d) the current and foreseeable economic or market conditions; 
(e) lending standards and recovery policies."|241
1366|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 29|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.4 Representativeness of data for calibration of risk parameters|"29. For the purpose of paragraph 28(a) institutions should perform an analysis as specified in 
paragraph 22."|53
1367|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 30|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.4 Representativeness of data for calibration of risk parameters|"30. For the purpose of paragraph 28(b) and in order to ensure that the definition of default 
underlying the data used for risk quantification from each data source is consistent with the 
requirements of Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should compare the 
definition of default applied by the institution currently with the definitions used for the 
observations included in the dataset used for risk quantification. Where the definition of 
default has changed during the historical observation period institutions should assess the 
representativeness of historical data included in the RDS and used for risk quantification in 
the same way as specified for external data in Chapter 6 of the EBA Guidelines on the 
application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 
Where the definition of default has changed during the historical observation period more 
than once, institutions should perform the analysis of each of the past definitions of default 
separately."|232
1368|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 31|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.4 Representativeness of data for calibration of risk parameters|"31. For the purpose of paragraph 28(c) institutions should perform an appropriate analysis to 
ensure that at the level of the calibration segment the ranges of values of the key risk 
characteristics in the application portfolio are comparable to those in the portfolio 
constituting the reference data set for risk quantification to the degree required to ensure 
that the risk quantification is not biased."|107
1369|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 32|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.4 Representativeness of data for calibration of risk parameters|"32. For the purpose of paragraph 28(d) institutions should perform the analysis of the market and 
economic conditions underlying the data in the following manner: 
(a) with regard to the PD estimation, in accordance with section 5.3.4; 
(b) with regard to the LGD estimation, in accordance with section 6.3.2 and taking into 
account the consideration of economic downturn as required by Article 181(1)(b) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."|137
1370|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 33|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.4 Representativeness of data for calibration of risk parameters|"33. For the purpose of paragraph 28(e) institutions should analyse whether there were significant 
changes in the lending standards or recovery policies over the relevant historical observation 
period that may influence the level of risk or the distribution or ranges of the characteristics 
of relevant risk drivers in the portfolio covered by the considered model. Where institutions 
observe such changes they should analyse the potential bias in the estimates of risk 
parameters resulting from these changes in the following manner: 
(c) with regard to the PD estimation, in terms of the level of default rates and the likely range 
of variability of default rates; 
(d) with regard to the LGD estimation, in terms of loss rates, average duration of the 
recovery processes, frequencies of use of certain recovery scenarios and the loss severity 
distributions."|190
1371|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 34|Data requirements|4 General estimation requirements > 4.2 Data requirements > 4.2.4 Representativeness of data for calibration of risk parameters|"34. Where the representativeness of data assessed in accordance with paragraphs 28 to 33 is 
insufficient and leads to a bias or increased uncertainty of risk quantification, institutions 
should introduce an appropriate adjustment to correct the bias and they should apply a 
margin of conservatism in accordance with section 4.4."|94
1372|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 35|General requirements to rating systems|4 General estimation requirements > 4.3 Human judgement in estimation of risk parameters|"35. In order for institutions to complement their statistical models with human judgement, as 
referred to in Articles 174(b), 174(e), 175(4), 179(1)(a) and 180(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013, they should do all of the following: 
(a) assess the modelling assumptions and whether the selected risk drivers contribute to the 
risk assessment in line with their economic meaning; 
(b) analyse the impact of the human judgement on the performance of the model and ensure 
that any form of human judgement is properly justified; 
(c) document the application of human judgement in the model, including at least the 
criteria for the assessment, rationale, assumptions, experts involved and description of 
the process."|178
1373|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 36|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.1 Identification of deficiencies|"36. Institutions should identify all deficiencies related to the estimation of risk parameters that 
lead to a bias in the quantification of those parameters or to an increased uncertainty that is 
not fully captured by the general estimation error, and classify each deficiency into one of the 
following categories: 
(a) Category A: Identified data and methodological deficiencies; 
(b) Category B: Relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and 
recovery policies and any other source of additional uncertainty."|126
1374|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 37|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.1 Identification of deficiencies|"37. For the purposes of identifying and classifying all deficiencies referred to in paragraph 36 
institutions should take into account all relevant deficiencies in methods, processes, controls, 
data or IT systems that have been identified by the credit risk control unit, validation function, 
internal audit function or any other internal or external review and should analyse at least all 
of the following potential sources of additional uncertainty in risk quantification: 
(a) under category A: 
(i) missing or materially changed default triggers in historical observations, including 
changed criteria for recognition of materially past due credit obligations; 
(ii) missing or inaccurate date of default; 
(iii) missing, inaccurate or outdated rating assignment used for assessing historical grades 
or pools for the purpose of calculation of default rates or average realised LGDs per 
grade or pool; 
(iv) missing or inaccurate information on the source of cash flows; 
(v) missing, inaccurate or outdated data on risk drivers and rating criteria; 
(vi) missing or inaccurate information used for the estimation of future recoveries as 
referred to in paragraph 159; 
(vii) missing or inaccurate data for the calculation of economic loss; 
(viii) limited representativeness of the historical observations due to the use of 
external data; 
(ix) potential bias stemming from the choice of the approach to calculating the average of 
observed one year default rates in accordance with paragraph 80; 
(x) necessity of adjusting the average of observed one-year default rates in accordance 
with paragraph 86; 
(xi) missing information for the purpose of estimating loss rates or for the purpose of 
reflecting economic downturn in LGD estimates; 
(b) under category B: 
(i) changes to underwriting standards, collection or recovery policies, risk appetite or 
other relevant internal processes; 
(ii) unjustified deviations in the ranges of values of the key risk characteristics of the 
application portfolio compared with those of the dataset used for risk quantification; 
(iii) changes to market or legal environment; 
(iv) forward-looking expectations regarding potential changes in the structure of the 
portfolio or the level of risk, especially based on actions or decisions that have already 
been taken but which are not reflected in the observed data."|483
1375|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 38|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.2 Appropriate adjustment|"38. In order to overcome biases in risk parameter estimates stemming from the identified 
deficiencies referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37, institutions should apply adequate 
methodologies to correct the identified deficiencies to the extent possible. The impact of 
these methodologies on the risk parameter (‘appropriate adjustment’), which should result in 
a more accurate estimate of the risk parameter (‘best estimate’), represents either an 
increase or a decrease in the value of the risk parameter. Institutions should ensure and 
provide evidence that the application of an appropriate adjustment results in a best estimate."|143
1376|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 39|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.2 Appropriate adjustment|"39. Institutions should document the methods used to apply appropriate adjustments to rectify 
the identified deficiencies, where relevant, as well as their justification."|56
1377|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 40|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.2 Appropriate adjustment|"40.

of an appropriate adjustment by institutions should not replace the need to address the 
identified deficiencies."|61
1378|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 41|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"41. In relation to the requirement that institutions should add a margin of conservatism (‘MoC’) 
that is related to the expected range of estimation errors as required by Articles 179(1)(f) and 
180(1)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should implement a framework for 
quantification, documentation and monitoring of estimation errors."|106

The final MoC on a risk parameter estimate should reflect the uncertainty of the estimation in 
all of the following categories: 
Category A: MoC related to data and methodological deficiencies identified under category 
A as referred to in paragraph 36(a); 
Category B: MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, 
collection and recovery policies and any other source of additional uncertainty identified 
under category B as referred to in paragraph 36(b); 
Category C: the general estimation error."|133
1380|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 43|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"43. In order to quantify MoC institutions should do all of the following: 
(a) quantify MoC for the identified deficiencies referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37, to 
the extent not covered by the general estimation error, at least for each of the 
categories A and B at the level of the calibration segment ensuring that: 
(i) where appropriate adjustments in the sense of paragraph 38 are used, the MoC 
accounts for any increase in the uncertainty or additional estimation error 
associated with these adjustments; 
(ii) the MoC at category level related to the appropriate adjustments is proportionate 
to the uncertainty around these adjustments; 
(iii) the MoC is applied to address the uncertainty of the risk parameter estimate 
stemming from any deficiencies among those referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 
that have not been corrected via appropriate adjustments as referred to in point (i); 
(b) quantify the general estimation error of category C referred to in paragraph 42 
associated with the underlying estimation method at least for every calibration 
segment; the MoC for the general estimation error should reflect the dispersion of 
the distribution of the statistical estimator."|263
1381|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 44|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"44. For the purpose of paragraph 43(a) and for each of the categories A and B, institutions may 
group all or selected deficiencies, where justified, for the purpose of quantifying MoC."|69
1382|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 45|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"45. Institutions should quantify the final MoC as the sum of: 
(a) the MoC under category A as referred to in paragraph 43(a); 
(b) the MoC under category B as referred to in paragraph 43(a); 
(c) the MoC for the general estimation error (category C) as referred to in paragraph 
43(b)."|101
1383|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 46|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|46. Institutions should add the final MoC to the best estimate of the risk parameter.|45
1384|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 47|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"47. Institutions should ensure that the impact of the final MoC does not result in lowering the risk 
parameter estimates and in particular that: 
(a) the MoC stemming from the general estimation error is greater than zero; 
(b) the MoC stemming from each of the categories A and B is proportionate to the 
increased uncertainty in the best estimate of risk parameters caused by the identified 
deficiencies listed in each category. In any case, the MoC under each of the categories 
A and B should be greater than or equal to zero."|140
1385|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 48|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"48. Institutions should consider the overall impact of the identified deficiencies and the resulting 
final MoC on the soundness of the model and ensure that the estimates of the risk 
parameters and the resulting own funds requirements are not distorted by the necessity for 
excessive adjustments."|81
1386|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 49|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"49. For each rating system, the MoC applied should be documented in the relevant model 
documentation and methodology manuals. The documentation should contain at least the 
following: 
(a) a complete list of all identified deficiencies, including errors and uncertainties, and the 
potentially affected model components or risk parameters; 
(b) the category under which these deficiencies are classified, as referred to in paragraph 42; 
(c) a description of the methods for quantification of the MoC related to identified 
deficiencies as referred to in paragraph 43(a) and in particular the methodologies used to 
quantify the MoC per category."|155
1387|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 50|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"50. Institutions should regularly monitor the levels of the MoC. The adoption of a MoC by 
institutions should not replace the need to address the causes of errors or uncertainties, or to 
correct the models to ensure their full compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 
No 575/2013. Following an assessment of the deficiencies or the sources of uncertainty, 
institutions should develop a plan to rectify the data and methodological deficiencies as well 
as any other potential source of additional uncertainty and reduce the estimation errors 
within a reasonable timeframe, taking into consideration the materiality of the estimation 
error and the materiality of the rating system."|161
1388|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 51|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"51. When reviewing the levels of the MoC institutions should ensure all of the following: 
(a) that the MoC stemming from categories A and B referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 is 
included in internal reporting separately for each category and may be reduced over time 
and eventually eliminated once the deficiencies are rectified in all parts of the rating 
system that were affected; 
(b) that the MoC stemming from the general estimation error referred to in paragraph 43(b) 
is included in internal reporting in a separate category (’C’); 
(c) that the level of the MoC is assessed as part of the regular reviews referred to in Chapter 
9 and in particular that the level of MoC related to the general estimation error remains 
appropriate after the inclusion of the most recent data relevant for the risk parameter 
estimation."|200
1389|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 52|Deficiencies and MoC|4 General estimation requirements > 4.4 Treatment of deficiencies and margin of conservatism > 4.4.3 Margin of conservatism|"52. Institutions should ensure that necessary changes in the MoC are implemented in a timely 
manner."|48
1390|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 53|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.1 General requirements specific to PD estimation|"53. For the purpose of assigning obligors to an obligor grade as part of the credit approval process 
in accordance with Article 172(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as well as for the 
purpose of the review of those assignments, in accordance with Article 173(1)(b) of that 
Regulation, institutions should ensure that each and every natural or legal person towards 
whom an IRB exposure exists is rated by the institution with the model approved to be used 
on a given type of exposures. This model should fit the single original obligor within the 
applicable rating system, including exposures secured by unfunded credit protection as 
referred to in Article 161(3) of that Regulation."|171
1391|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 54|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.1 General requirements specific to PD estimation|"54. For the purpose of assigning retail exposures to a grade or pool as part of the credit approval 
process in accordance with Article 172(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as well as for the 
purpose of the review of those assignments in accordance with Article 173(2) of that 
Regulation, institutions should ensure that each and every IRB exposure is rated by the

Regulation."|160
1392|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 55|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.1 General requirements specific to PD estimation|"55. A PD model can contain several different methods for ranking the obligors or exposures as 
well as various calibration segments."|40
1393|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 56|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.1 Data requirements specific for model development|"56. For the purpose of model development, institutions should ensure that the RDS contains the 
values of the risk drivers for appropriate points in time. These points in time may vary 
between different risk drivers. In the selection of appropriate points in time institutions 
should take into account the dynamics as well as the update frequency of the risk drivers 
throughout the whole period in which an obligor was in the portfolio and, in the case of a 
default, throughout the year prior to default."|127
1394|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 57|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.2 Risk drivers and rating criteria|"57. In the process of selecting risk drivers and rating criteria, institutions should consider a broad 
set of information relevant to the type of exposures covered by the rating system. Potential 
risk drivers analysed by institutions should include in particular the following: 
(a) obligor characteristics, including sector and geographic location for corporates; 
(b) financial information, including financial statements or income statements; 
(c) trend information, including growing or shrinking sales or profit margin; 
(d) behavioural information, including delinquency and the use of credit facilities."|135
1395|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 58|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.2 Risk drivers and rating criteria|"58. Institutions should ensure that for the purpose of selecting risk drivers and rating criteria the 
relevant experts from business areas of the institution are consulted with respect to the 
business rationale and risk contribution of the considered risk drivers and rating criteria."|73
1396|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 59|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.2 Risk drivers and rating criteria|"59. Institutions should ensure that the decrease of reliability of information over time, for 
instance of information on obligor characteristics obtained at the time of the loan origination, 
is appropriately reflected in the PD estimation. Institutions should also ensure that the model 
estimates the proper level of risk with respect to all relevant, currently available and most up-
to-date information and that an adequate MoC is applied where a higher degree of 
uncertainty exists due to the lack of up-to-date information. In particular the model or the 
assignment process should provide for an adequate and conservative adjustment in both of 
the following situations: 
(a) in accordance with Article 24(1)(g) of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, in case of 
financial statements older than 24 months where information stemming from these 
financial statements is a relevant risk driver; 
(b) in the case of credit bureau information that is older than 24 months, if still relevant at 
that point in time, where credit bureau information is a relevant risk driver."|237
1397|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 60|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.2 Risk drivers and rating criteria|"60. Institutions should use the risk drivers and rating criteria consistently, in particular with 
respect to the considered time horizon, in model development, model calibration and model 
application."|61
1398|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 61|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.2 Risk drivers and rating criteria|"61. Where there is a significant proportion of customers using multiple facilities of the same type 
within a considered retail rating system institutions should analyse the level of risk of such 
customers compared with customers carrying only one facility of the relevant type and, 
where necessary, reflect the difference in the level of risk in the model through appropriate 
risk drivers."|95
1399|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 62|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.3 Treatment of ratings of third parties|"62. Institutions should have clear policies specifying the conditions under which the rating of a 
third party who has a contractual or organisational relation with an obligor of the institution 
may be taken into account in the assessment of risk of the considered obligor. Such policies 
should take into account the following possible manners in which the rating of such a third 
party may be taken into account in the assessment of risk of the considered obligor: 
(a) the rating of such third party being transferred to a relevant obligor (‘rating transfer’), 
where there is no difference in risk between the obligor and the related party because of 
the existence of an appropriate guarantee and the rating of a third party is assigned 
internally in accordance with the rating system for which the institution has received 
permission in accordance with Article 143(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; 
(b) the rating of a such third party being taken into account as an indication for an override of 
the assignment of the relevant obligor to a grade or pool; 
(c) the rating of such a third party serving as an input to the PD model, reflecting contractual 
support of the related party for the obligor."|276
1400|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 63|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.3 Treatment of ratings of third parties|"63. In order for an internal or external ratings of a third party to be incorporated into a PD model, 
institutions should ensure all of the following: 
(a) that the rating of a third party fulfils all the requirements for relevant risk drivers set out 
in section 5.2.2; 
(b) that other relevant obligor and transaction risk characteristics are properly reflected in 
the model in accordance with Articles 170(1)(a) and 170(3)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013, and that no material biases are introduced by a high weighting of the internal 
or external rating information; 
(c) that there is no double counting of effects of any relations to third parties."|179
1401|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 64|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.3 Treatment of ratings of third parties|"64. A rating transfer should not change the assignment of exposures to exposure classes, rating 
systems or models, but should only affect the assignment to grades or pools. Rating transfers 
should be set up in such a way that any changes to a rating of a third party which is material 
information on the obligor or exposure with regard to Article 173(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013 is reflected in all influenced ratings in a timely manner."|125
1402|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 65|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.3 Treatment of ratings of third parties|"65. The material contractual support granted by an obligor to a third party should be seen as 
diminishing the free financial strength of the supporting obligor, including the strength to 
repay all obligations to the institution in full. This should be reflected in the rating of the 
supporting obligor."|90
1403|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 66|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.4 Rating philosophy|"66. Institutions should choose an appropriate philosophy underlying the assignment of obligors 
or exposures to grades or pools (‘rating philosophy’) taking into account all of the following 
principles: 
(a) Institutions should assess whether the method used to quantify the risk parameter is 
adequate for the rating philosophy and understand the characteristics and dynamics of 
the assignment of obligors or exposures to grades or pools (‘rating assignment’) and of 
the risk parameter estimates that result from the method used. 
(b) Institutions should assess the adequacy of the resulting characteristics and dynamics of 
the rating assignment and risk parameter estimates that result from the method used, 
with regard to their various uses and should understand their impact on the dynamics and 
volatility of own funds requirements. 
(c) The rating philosophy should also be taken into account for back testing purposes. 
Philosophies sensitive to economic conditions tend to estimate PDs that are better 
predictors of each year’s default rates. On the other hand, philosophies less sensitive to 
economic conditions tend to estimate PDs that are closer to the average PD across the 
various states of the economy, but that differ from observed default rates in years where 
the state of the economy is above or below its average. Deviations between observed 
default rates and the long-run average default rate of the relevant grade will hence be 
more likely in rating systems less sensitive to economic conditions. In contrast, migrations 
among grades will be more likely in rating systems which are more sensitive to economic 
conditions. These patterns should be taken into account when assessing the results of 
back-testing and, where relevant, benchmarking analysis."|358
1404|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 67|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.4 Rating philosophy|"67. Institutions should apply the chosen rating philosophy consistently over time. Institutions 
should analyse the appropriateness of the philosophy underlying the assignment of obligors 
or exposures to grades or pools (‘rating philosophy’), taking into account all of the following: 
(a) design of risk drivers; 
(b) migration across grades or pools; 
(c) changes in the yearly default rates of each grade or pool."|106
1405|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 68|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.4 Rating philosophy|"68. Where institutions use different rating systems characterised by different rating philosophies, 
they should use the information on the rating assignments or risk parameters estimates with 
caution, especially when making use of rating information or default experience obtained 
from external rating agencies. Where institutions use different rating systems with different 
characteristics, such as different philosophies or different levels of objectivity, accuracy, 
stability, or conservatism, they should ensure that the rating systems have an appropriate 
level of consistency and that any differences between them are well understood. Such 
understanding should at least enable the institution to define an appropriate way to combine 
or aggregate the information produced by the various rating systems when this is necessary 
according to the institution’s policies. Institutions should have full understanding of the 
assumptions and potential inaccuracies arising from such a combination or aggregation."|195
1406|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 69|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.2 Model development in PD estimation > 5.2.5 Homogeneity of obligor grades or pools|"69. In order to comply with the requirements of Article 170(1) and 170(3)(c) of Regulation (EU) 
No 575/2013 and of Article 38 of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, institutions should 
check the homogeneity of obligors or exposures assigned to the same grades or pools. In 
particular, grades should be defined in such a manner that each obligor within each grade or 
pool has a reasonably similar risk of default and that significant overlaps of the distributions 
of the default risk between grades or pools are avoided."|148
1407|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 70|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.1 Data requirements for the calculation of observed default rates|"70. For the purpose of calculating the one-year default rate defined in point (78) of Article 4(1) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should ensure the completeness of the quantitative 
and qualitative data and other information in relation to the denominator and numerator as 
outlined in paragraphs 73 and 74 and used for the calculation of the observed average default 
rate. In particular, institutions should ensure that at least the following data for the relevant 
observation period referred to in paragraphs 82 to 83 is properly stored and available: 
(a) the criteria for identifying the relevant type of exposures covered by the PD model under 
consideration; 
(b) the criteria for identifying the calibration segments; 
(c) the risk drivers used for risk differentiation; where a newly relevant risk driver has been 
included in the model for which no historical data is available institutions should, make 
efforts to minimise missing data on risk drivers over time as outlined in paragraph 51(a), 
and apply an appropriate adjustment and a MoC in accordance with section 4.4; 
(d) all identification numbers of obligors and exposures relevant for default rate calculation, 
taking into account situations where the identification number has changed over time, 
including changes due to restructuring of exposures."|291
1408|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 71|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.1 Data requirements for the calculation of observed default rates|"71. Exclusion of observations from the one-year default rate calculation should be undertaken 
only in the following two situations: 
(a) obligors wrongly included in the data set of defaults, as they did not default in the 
meaning of the definition of default pursuant to Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013 as further specified in the Guidelines on the application of the definition of 
default of an obligor under that Article should not be included in the numerator of the 
one-year default rate; 
(b) obligors wrongly assigned to the considered rating model, despite not falling in the range 
of application of that rating model, should be excluded from both the numerator and the 
denominator of the one-year default rate."|178
1409|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 72|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.1 Data requirements for the calculation of observed default rates|"72. Institutions should document all data cleansing in accordance with Article 32(3)(b) of the RTS 
on IRB assessment methodology, with respect to the one-year default rate calculation and in 
particular: 
(a) for non-retail PD models, a list of all observations within the dataset that were excluded 
according to paragraph 71, with a case-by-case justification; 
(b) for retail PD models, information on the reasons and quantity of exclusions of 
observations made in accordance with paragraph 71."|134
1410|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 73|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.2 Calculation of one-year default rates|"73. For the purpose of calculating the one-year default rate referred to in point (78) of Article 4(1) 
of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should ensure both of the following: 
(a) that the denominator consists of the number of non-defaulted obligors with any credit 
obligation observed at the beginning of the one-year observation period; in this context a 
credit obligation refers to both of the following: 
(i) any on balance sheet item, including any amount of principal, interest and fees; 
(ii) any off-balance sheet items, including guarantees issued by the institution as a 
guarantor. 
(b) that the numerator includes all those obligors considered in the denominator that had at 
least one default event during the one-year observation period."|191
1411|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 74|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.2 Calculation of one-year default rates|"74. When assigning the obligors or exposures to grades or pools for the purpose of the one-year 
default rate calculation, institutions should take overrides into account, but they should not 
reflect in this assignment any substitution effects due to credit risk mitigation, nor any ex post 
conservative adjustments introduced in accordance with section 8.1. Where the one-year 
default rate is calculated by rating grade or pool, the denominator should refer to all obligors 
assigned to a rating grade or pool at the beginning of the observation period. Where the one-
year default rate is calculated at the portfolio level, the denominator should refer to all 
obligors assigned to the relevant calibration segment at the beginning of the observation 
period."|170
1412|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 75|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.2 Calculation of one-year default rates|"75. Institutions should calculate the one-year default rate also for the subset of obligors with any 
credit obligation that did not have a rating at the start of the relevant observation period, but 
which were within the range of application of the model under consideration (‘missing 
ratings’), even if these obligors were assigned to a rating grade or pool in a conservative 
manner for the purpose of calculation of own funds requirements. Obligors whose ratings are 
based on missing or partly missing information or where the rating is outdated but still 
deemed valid by the institution should not be considered as missing ratings."|148
1413|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 76|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.2 Calculation of one-year default rates|"76. For the purposes of paragraphs 73 to 75 an obligor has to be included in the denominator 
and, where relevant, numerator, also in the case of a migration to a different rating grade, 
pool or rating model, rating system or approach to calculation of capital requirements within 
the observation period or where the corresponding credit obligations were sold, written off, 
repaid or otherwise closed during the observation period. Institutions should analyse whether 
such migrations or sales of credit obligations bias the default rate and, if so, they should 
reflect this in an appropriate adjustment and consider an adequate MoC."|147
1414|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 77|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.2 Calculation of one-year default rates|"77. In any case institutions should ensure that each defaulted obligor is counted only once in the 
numerator and denominator of the one-year default rate calculation, even where the obligor 
defaulted more than once during the relevant one-year period."|74
1415|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 78|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.2 Calculation of one-year default rates|"78. In order to choose an appropriate calculation approach as required by paragraph 80, 
institutions should evaluate the observed one year default rates within the historical 
observation period at least quarterly."|62
1416|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 79|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.3 Calculation of the observed average default rate|"79. The observed average of one-year default rates (‘observed average default rate’) should be 
calculated for each rating grade or pool and additionally for the type of exposures covered by 
the relevant PD model as well as for any relevant calibration segment."|77
1417|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 80|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.3 Calculation of the observed average default rate|"80. Institutions should choose an appropriate approach between an approach based on 
overlapping and an approach based on non-overlapping one-year time windows, to calculate 
the observed average default rate based on a documented analysis. This analysis should 
include at least the following: 
(a) an analysis of possible bias due to the proportion of short-term and terminated contracts 
that cannot be observed during the relevant one-year periods; 
(b) an analysis of possible bias due to the specific calculation dates chosen; 
(c) for institutions using overlapping one-year time windows, an analysis of potentially 
significant bias due to implicit over-weighting of the overlapping time period; 
(d) an analysis of potentially significant bias due to seasonal effect related to the chosen 
calculation dates."|177
1418|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 81|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.3 Calculation of the observed average default rate|"81. For the purposes of paragraphs 79 and 80 institutions should calculate the observed average 
default rates as the arithmetic average of all one year default rates calculated in accordance 
with paragraphs 73 to 76. In the case of PD models for retail exposure class institutions may 
calculate the observed average default rate as a weighted average of one-year default rates 
where an institution does not give equal importance to historic data because more recent 
data is a better predictor of losses in accordance with Article 180(2)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013."|142
1419|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 82|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.4 Long-run average default rate|"82. For the purpose of determining the historical observation period referred to in Articles 
180(1)(h) and 180(2)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, additional observations to the most 
recent 5 years, at the time of model calibration, should be considered relevant when these 
observations are required in order for the historical observation period to reflect the likely 
range of variability of default rates of that type of exposures as referred to in Article 49(3) of 
the RTS on IRB assessment methodology."|136
1420|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 83|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.4 Long-run average default rate|"83. For the purpose of assessing the representativeness of the historical observation period 
referred to in paragraph 82 for the likely range of variability of one-year-default rates, 
institutions should assess whether the historical observation period contains a representative 
mix of good and bad years, and they should take into account all of the following: 
(a) the variability of all observed one-year-default rates; 
(b) the existence, lack or prevalence of one-year default rates relating to bad years as 
reflected by economic indicators that are relevant for the considered type of exposures 
within the historical observation period; 
(c) significant changes in the economic, legal or business environment within the historical 
observation period."|165
1421|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 84|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.4 Long-run average default rate|"84. Where the historical observation period referred to in paragraph 82 is representative of the 
likely range of variability of the default rates, the long-run average default rate should be 
computed as the observed average of the one-year default rates in that period."|74
1422|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 85|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.4 Long-run average default rate|"85. Where the historical observation period referred to in paragraph 82 is not representative of 
the likely range of variability of default rates as referred to in Article 49(4) of the RTS on IRB 
assessment methodology, institutions should apply the following: 
(a) where no or insufficient bad years are included in the historical observation period the 
average of observed one year default rates should be adjusted in order to estimate a 
long-run average default rate; 
(b) where bad years are over-represented in the historical observation period, the average 
of observed one-year default rates may be adjusted to estimate a long-run average 
default rate where there is a significant correlation between economic indicators 
referred to in paragraph 83(b) and the available one-year default rates. 

Institutions should ensure that, as a result of the adjustments referred to in points (a) and 
(b), the adjusted long-run average default rate reflects the likely range of variability of 
default rates."|222
1423|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 86|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.4 Long-run average default rate|"86. In the exceptional case where the long-run average default rate is below the average of all 
observed one-year default rates due to any adjustment made in accordance with paragraph 
85, institutions should compare their adjusted long-run average default rates with the higher 
of the following: 
(a) the observed average of the one-year default rates of the most recent 5 years; 
(b) the observed average of all available one-year default rates. 

Institutions should justify the direction and magnitude of the adjustment, including the 
adequacy of the considered MoC, in line with the requirement in Article 49(4)(b) of the RTS on 
IRB assessment methodology and section 4.4. In addition, where the adjusted long-run 
average default rate is lower than the higher of the two values referred to in points (a) and 
(b), they should specifically justify why these two values are not appropriate."|212
1424|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 87|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"87. Institutions should have sound and well-defined processes in place which ensure sound 
calibration by including all of the following in their calibration process: 
(a) quantitative calibration tests by rating grade or pool; 
(b) quantitative calibration tests on calibration segment level; 
(c) supplementary qualitative analyses such as expert judgements on the shape of the 
resulting obligor distribution, minimum obligor numbers per grade and avoidance of 
undue concentration in certain grades or pools."|120
1425|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 88|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"88. Institutions should store and describe in the documentation of the PD model the calibration 
sample associated with each calibration segment. In order to ensure compliance with Article 
180(1)(a) or 180(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should find an appropriate 
balance between the comparability of the calibration sample with the application portfolio in 
terms of obligor and transaction characteristics and its representativeness of the likely range 
of variability of default rates as referred to in section 5.3.4."|139
1426|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 89|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"89. Institutions should conduct the calibration after taking into account any overrides applied in 
the assignment of obligors to grades or pools, and before the application of MoC or floors to 
PD estimates as referred to in Articles 160(1) and 163(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. 
Where a ranking method or overrides policy has changed over time, institutions should 
analyse the effects of these changes on the frequency and scope of overrides and take them 
into account appropriately."|131
1427|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 90|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"90. The process of grouping ranked obligors or exposures to grades or pools, in particular where 
institutions conduct this grouping by identification of intervals of score values reflecting a 
predefined PD level assigned to a grade of a master scale, may be performed during the 
calibration."|83
1428|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 91|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"91. Taking into account the availability of data, the structure of the model and portfolio as well as 
the business requirements, institutions should choose an appropriate method to perform the 
calibration in accordance with the following principles: 
(a) institutions may choose one of the following types of calibration: 
(i) a calibration in accordance with Article 180(1)(a) or 180(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) 
No 575/2013; 
(ii) a calibration in accordance with Article 169(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in 
combination with Article 180(1)(a) or 180(2)(a) of that Regulation if a continuous 
rating scale is used; 
(b) for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks and for 
equity exposures where an institution uses the PD/LGD approach set out in Article 155(3) 
of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions may choose one of the following types of 
calibration: 
(i) a calibration based on a mapping to the rating scale used by an external credit 
assessment institution (ECAI) or similar organisation in accordance with Article 
180(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; 
(ii) for a statistical default prediction model, in accordance with Section 4 of the RTS 
on IRB assessment methodology, where the PDs are estimated as simple averages 
of default probability estimates for individual obligors in a given grade or pool in 
accordance with Article 180(1)(g) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a calibration at 
the level of appropriate calibration segments of the relevant default probability 
estimates; 
(c) for retail exposures institutions may choose a calibration based on total losses and LGDs 
in accordance with Articles 180(2)(b) and 180(2)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; 
(d) for corporate purchased receivables institutions may choose a calibration based on 
expected losses and LGDs in accordance with Articles 180(1)(b) and 180(1)(c) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."|496
1429|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 92|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"92. For the purpose of determining the PD estimates referred to in paragraph 91, the calibration 
should consider either: 
(a) the long-run average default rate at the level of grade or pool, in which case institutions 
should provide additional calibration tests at the level of the relevant calibration 
segment; or 
(b) the long-run average default rate at the level of the calibration segment, in which case 
institutions should provide additional calibration tests at the level of the relevant grades 
or pools or, where they use direct PD estimates in accordance with Article 169(3) of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, at a level that is appropriate for the application of the 
probability model."|172
1430|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 93|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"93. Irrespective of which of the approaches mentioned in paragraph 92 institutions choose, they 
should assess the potential effect of the chosen calibration method on the behaviour of PD 
estimates over time."|67
1431|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 94|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"94. For the purpose of determining PD estimates based on a mapping to an external rating scale 
as referred to in paragraph 91(b)((i)), institutions should base the default rates observed for 
the external organisation’s grades on a time series representative of the likely range of 
variability of default rates for the grades and pools of the given portfolio."|96
1432|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 95|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"95. Where institutions derive PD estimates from the estimates of losses and LGDs in accordance 
with Articles 161(2) and 180(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 they should use a RDS that 
includes realised losses on all defaults identified during the historical observation period 
specified in accordance with section 6.3.2.1 and relevant drivers of loss."|110
1433|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 96|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"96. In order to use direct PD estimates for the calculation of own funds requirements in 
accordance with Article 169(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions should 
demonstrate that the theoretical assumptions of the probability model underlying the 
estimation methodology are met to a sufficient extent in practice and that the long-run 
average default rate is retained. In particular, all data and representativeness requirements 
should be met, including those in Article 174(c) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, and the 
definition of default should be applied in accordance with Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 
575/2013. Under no circumstances should the use of continuous PDs or any smoothening of 
default rates be adopted in order to overcome the lack of data, low discriminatory capacity or 
any other deficiencies in the rating assignment or PD estimation process, or to reduce the 
own funds requirements."|225
1434|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 97|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"97. Institutions may split exposures covered by the same PD model into as many different 
calibration segments as needed where one or more subsets of these exposures carry a 
significantly different level of risk. For this purpose institutions should use relevant 
segmentation drivers and they should justify and document the use and scope of the 
calibration segments."|94
1435|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 98|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"98. Where scoring methods are used, institutions should ensure that: 
(a) where there is a change in the scoring method used, the institutions consider whether it is 
necessary to recalculate scores of obligors or exposures based on the original dataset 
instead of using scores that were calculated based on previous versions of the scoring 
method, and, where such recalculation is not possible, that institutions assess potential 
effects and take those effects into account via an appropriate increase of the MoC to their 
PD estimates; 
(b) where Article 180(1)(g) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 applies, the PD estimates which 
were derived as a simple average of individual PD estimates are adequate for relevant 
grades, by applying calibration tests to these estimates at a grade level, on the basis of 
one-year default rates representative of the likely range of variability of default rates."|209
1436|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 99|PD modelling|5 PD estimation > 5.3 PD calibration > 5.3.5 Calibration to the long-run average default rate|"99. The calibration should not influence the rank ordering of obligors or exposures within a 
calibration segment other than within each grade or pool."|55
1437|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 100|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.1 LGD estimation methodologies|"100. Institutions that have obtained permission to use own estimates of LGD in accordance 
with Article 143(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should assign an LGD estimate to each 
non-defaulted exposure and an estimate of LGD in-default and ELBE to each defaulted 
exposure within the range of application of the rating system subject to such permission in 
accordance with Articles 172 and 173 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Institutions should 
estimate LGDs for all facility grades of the distinct facility rating scale or for all pools that are 
incorporated in the rating system. For the purpose of LGD estimation institutions should treat 
each defaulted facility as a distinct default observation, unless more than one independent 
defaults were recognised on a single facility which do not meet the conditions of paragraph 101."|205
1438|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 101|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.1 LGD estimation methodologies|"101. For the purpose of LGD estimation, with regard to defaults recognised on a single facility, 
where the time between the moment of the return of the exposure to non-defaulted status 
and the subsequent classification as default is shorter than nine months, institutions should 
treat such exposure as having been constantly defaulted from the first moment when the 
default occurred. Institutions may specify a period longer than nine months for the purpose 
of considering two subsequent defaults as a single default in the LGD estimation, if this is 
adequate to the specific type of exposures and reflects the economic meaning of the default 
experience."|152
1439|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 102|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.1 LGD estimation methodologies|"102. Institutions should estimate their own LGDs based on their own loss and recovery 
experience, as it is reflected in historical data on defaulted exposures. Institutions may 
supplement their own historical data on defaulted exposures with external data. In particular, 
institutions should not derive their LGD estimates only from the market prices of financial 
instruments, including, but not limited to, marketable loans, bonds or credit default 
instruments, but they may use this information to supplement their own historical data."|130
1440|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 103|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.1 LGD estimation methodologies|"103. Where in the case of retail exposures and purchased corporate receivables institutions 
derive LGD estimates from realised losses and appropriate estimates of PDs in accordance 
with Articles 161(2) and 181(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 they should ensure that: 
(a) the process for estimating total losses meets the requirements of Article 179 of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the outcome is consistent with the concept of LGD as 
set out in Article 181(1)(a) of this Regulation, as well as with the requirements specified in 
Chapter 6, in particular with the concept of economic loss as specified in section 6.3.1; 
(b) the process for estimating PD meets the requirements of Articles 179 and 180 of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as well as the requirements specified in Chapter 5."|223
1441|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 104|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.1 LGD estimation methodologies|"104. An LGD model can contain several different methods, especially with respect to different 
types of collateral, which are combined to arrive at an LGD for a given facility."|64
1442|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 105|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.1 LGD estimation methodologies|"105. Institutions should be able to demonstrate that the methods that they choose for the 
purpose of LGD estimation are appropriate to their activities and the type of exposures to 
which the estimates apply and they should be able to justify the theoretical assumptions 
underlying those methods. The methods used in the LGD estimation should in particular be 
consistent with the collection and recovery policies adopted by the institution and should 
take into account possible recovery scenarios as well as potential differences in the legal 
environment in relevant jurisdictions."|129
1443|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 106|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.1 LGD estimation methodologies|"106. The methods used by the institution in the LGD estimation, the assumptions underlying 
these methods, the institution’s consideration of any downturn effect, the length of data 
series used, the MoC, the human judgement and, where applicable, the choice of risk drivers, 
should be adequate to the type of exposures to which they are applied."|99
1444|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 107|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.2 Data requirements for LGD estimation|"107. For the purpose of LGD estimation institutions should use an RDS covering all of the 
following items: 
(a) all defaults identified during the historical observation period specified in accordance with 
section 6.3.2.1; 
(b) all data necessary for calculating realised LGDs in accordance with section 6.3.1; 
(c) relevant factors that can be used to group the defaulted exposures in meaningful ways 
and relevant drivers of loss, including their values at the moment of default and at least 
within the year before default when available."|145
1445|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 108|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.2 Data requirements for LGD estimation|"108. Institutions should include in the RDS information on the results of the recovery 
processes, including recoveries and costs, related to each individual defaulted exposure. To 
this end institutions should include: 
(a) information on the results of incomplete recovery processes until the reference date for 
the LGD estimation; 
(b) information on the results of recovery processes at portfolio level, where such 
aggregation of the information is justified, and in particular in the case of indirect costs 
and sale of a portfolio of credit obligations. 
(c) information on external or pooled data used in the estimation of LGDs."|154
1446|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 109|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.2 Data requirements for LGD estimation|"109. The RDS should contain at least the following information: 
(a) obligor-related, transaction-related and institution-related risk characteristics as well as 
external factors as referred to in paragraph 121 that are potential risk drivers at the 
relevant reference dates as specified in paragraph 122; 
(b) moment (date) of default; 
(c) all default triggers that have occurred, including both past due events and unlikeliness to

1447|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 110|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.2 Data requirements for LGD estimation|"110. In accordance with Article 229(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions may use 
various methods for the valuation of the collateral in the form of immovable property 
including in particular market value or mortgage lending value as defined in points (74) and 
(76) of Article 4(1) of that Regulation. Where institutions use various valuation approaches 
with regard to immovable properties that secure exposures included in the range of 
application of a certain rating system, they should collect and store in the RDS the 
information on the type of valuation and they should use this information consistently in the 
LGD estimation and in the application of LGD estimates."|173
1448|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 111|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.2 Data requirements for LGD estimation|"111. Where institutions derive LGD estimates from realised losses and appropriate estimates 
of PDs in accordance with Articles 161(2) and 181(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 they 
should use a RDS that includes realised losses on all defaults identified during the historical

1449|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 112|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.2 Data requirements for LGD estimation|"112. Where aggregated information is collected and stored, institutions should develop an 
appropriate methodology for the allocation of recoveries and costs to individual defaulted 
exposures and should apply this methodology consistently across exposures and over time. In 
any case institutions should demonstrate that the process of allocation of recoveries and 
costs is effective and that it does not lead to biased LGD estimates."|107
1450|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 113|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.2 Data requirements for LGD estimation|"113. Institutions should demonstrate that they collect and store in their databases all 
information required to calculate direct and indirect costs. All material indirect costs should 
be allocated to the corresponding exposures. This cost allocation process should be based on 
the same principles and techniques that institutions use in their own cost accounting systems. 
For the purpose of indirect cost allocation institutions may use methods based on exposure 
weighted averages, or statistical methods based on a representative sample within the 
population of defaulted obligors or facilities."|129
1451|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 114|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.2 Data requirements for LGD estimation|"114. Institutions should take reasonable steps to recognise the sources of the cash flows and 
allocate them adequately to the specific collateral or unfunded credit protection that has 
been realised. Where the source of the cash flows cannot be identified, institutions should 
specify clear policies for the treatment and allocation of such recovery cash flows, which 
should not lead to a bias in LGD estimation."|107
1452|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 115|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.3 Recoveries from collaterals|"115. Institutions should recognise the recoveries as stemming from collaterals in all of the 
following situations: 
(a) the collateral is sold by the obligor and the obtained price has been used to cover parts or 
all of the outstanding amount of the defaulted credit obligation; 
(b) the collateral is repossessed or sold by the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its 
subsidiaries on behalf of the institution; 
(c) the collateral is sold in a public auction of the property by court order or in a similar 
procedure in accordance with the applicable legal framework; 
(d) the credit obligation is sold together with the collateral and the sale price for the credit 
obligation included the existing collateral; 
(e) in the case of leasing, the leasing object is sold by the institution; 
(f) the collateral is realised by any other method that is eligible under the legal framework of 
the relevant jurisdiction."|219
1453|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 116|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.3 Recoveries from collaterals|"116. For the purpose of point (b) of paragraph 115 institutions should determine the value of 
repossession as the value by which the credit obligation of the obligor has been diminished as 
a result of the repossession of the collateral, and with which the repossessed collateral was 
recorded as an asset on the balance sheet of the institution. Where these values are different 
institutions should consider the lower of the two the value of repossession. The value of 
repossession should be considered a value of recovery at the date of repossession and should 
be included in the calculation of the economic loss and realised LGD in accordance with 
section 6.3.1."|171
1454|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 117|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.3 Recoveries from collaterals|"117. Institutions should consider whether the value of repossession adequately reflects the 
value of the repossessed collateral, consistently with any established internal requirements 
for collateral management, legal certainty and risk management. Where the collateral 
repossessed meets the criteria for high quality liquid assets at Level 1, as defined in Article 10 
of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, institutions may take into account directly 
as a realised recovery the market value of the collateral at the time of the repossession. In all 
other cases institutions should apply an appropriate haircut to the value of repossession and 
include in the calculation of economic loss a recovery in the amount of the value of 
repossession after applying the appropriate haircut. Institutions should estimate this haircut 
taking into account all of the following conditions: 
(a) the haircut should reflect possible errors in the valuation of the collateral at the moment 
of repossession taking into account the type of the valuation available at the moment of 
repossession, the date it was performed and the liquidity of the market for this type of 
asset; 
(b) the haircut should be estimated with the assumption that the institution intends to sell 
the repossessed collateral to an independent third party and should reflect the potential 
price that could be achieved from such sale, the costs of the sale and the discounting 
effect for the period from the sale to the moment of repossession taking into account the 
liquidity of the market for this type of assets; 
(c) where there are observations available regarding the repossessions and subsequent sales 
of similar types of collaterals the estimation of the haircut should be based on these 
observations and should be regularly backtested; for this purpose institutions should take 
into account all of the following: 
(i) the difference between the value of repossession and the sale price, especially 
where there were no significant changes in market and economic conditions 
between the moment of the repossession and the moment of the sale; 
(ii) any income and costs related to this asset that were observed between the date 
of repossession and the moment of the sale; 
(iii) discounting effects; 
(iv) whether the institution repossessed the collateral with the intention of 
immediate sale or whether another strategy was adopted. 
(d) where historical observations regarding the repossessions and subsequent sales of similar 
types of collaterals are not available the estimation of the haircut should be based on a 
case-by-case assessment, including the analysis of the current market and economic 
conditions; 
(e) the fewer data an institution has on previous repossessions and the less liquid the market 
for the given type of assets is, the more uncertainty is attached to the resulting estimates, 
which should be adequately reflected in the MoC in accordance with section 4.4.3."|611
1455|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 118|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.3 Recoveries from collaterals|"118. In any case the repossession of collateral should be recognised at the moment of

(a) where institutions regularly sell credit obligations as part of their recovery processes, they 
should appropriately reflect the observations related to credit obligations subject to the 
sale in the model development process; 
(b) where institutions do not regularly sell credit obligations as part of their recovery 
processes and the allocation of the part of the price related to collaterals is too 
burdensome to make or too unreliable, they may decide not to take these observations 
into account in the process of model development; 
(c) institutions should not treat recoveries from the sales of the secured credit obligations as 
recoveries realised without the use of collaterals unless they can demonstrate that the 
recoveries related to these collaterals are immaterial; 
(d) in any case institutions should include all observations, including the sales of credit 
obligations, in the calculation of long-run average LGD."|258
1457|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 120|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.1 General requirements specific to LGD estimation > 6.1.3 Recoveries from collaterals|"120. In accordance with point (f) of paragraph 115 institutions may specify and recognise any 
other forms of realising collaterals adequate to the types of collaterals used by the institution 
that are eligible under the applicable legal framework. When recognising such other forms of 
realising collateral, institutions should take into account the fact that the collateral may take 
various forms and that various forms of collaterals may be related to the same asset. Where 
different forms of collateral refer to the same asset but the realisation of one of the 
collaterals does not decrease the value of the other, institutions should consider them 
separate collaterals in the process of LGD estimation. In particular, institutions should 
recognise separately the form of collateral which gives a right to repossess or sell the asset 
(such as a mortgage) and the form of collateral which gives a right to collect cash flows 
generated by the asset (such as a cession of rent or fees)."|235
1458|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 121|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.2 Model development in LGD estimation > 6.2.1 Risk drivers|"121. Institutions should identify and analyse potential risk drivers that are relevant to their 
specific circumstances and to the specific characteristics of the type of exposures covered by 
the rating system. Potential risk drivers analysed by institutions should include in particular 
the following: 
(a) transaction-related risk characteristics, including type of product, type of collateral, 
geographical location of the collateral, unfunded credit protection, seniority, Loan-to-
Value ratio (LtV), exposure size, seasoning, and recovery procedures; 
(b) obligor-related risk characteristics, including, where applicable, size, capital structure, 
geographical region, industrial sector, and line of business; 
(c) institution-related factors, including internal organisation and internal governance, 
relevant events such as mergers, and existence of specific entities within the group 
dedicated to recoveries; 
(d) external factors, including interest rates, legal framework and other factors influencing 
the expected length of the recovery process."|219
1459|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 122|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.2 Model development in LGD estimation > 6.2.1 Risk drivers|"122. Institutions should analyse the risk drivers not only at the moment of default but also at 
least within a year before default. Institutions should use a reference date for a risk driver 
that is representative of the realisations of the risk driver within a year before default. When 
choosing the appropriate reference date for a risk driver institutions should take into account 
its volatility over time. Institutions should apply these practices also with regard to the 
reference date of the valuation of collateral; the value of the collateral at the reference date 
should not reflect the impact of the decrease in credit quality of the exposure shortly before 
default."|150
1460|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 123|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.2 Model development in LGD estimation > 6.2.1 Risk drivers|"123. Institutions should specify or calculate the risk drivers in the application of LGD estimates

may take into account in their LGD estimations the existence of any types of collaterals for 
which they have established internal requirements in terms of collateral management, legal 
certainty and risk management that are generally consistent with those set out in Section 3 of 
Chapter 4 of Title II in Part Three of that Regulation. In the case of the types of collateral that 
are not specified in Chapter 4 of Title II in Part Three of that Regulation institutions may use 
those types of collaterals in their LGD estimations where their policies and procedures 
relating to internal requirements for valuation and legal certainty of these collaterals are 
appropriate to the respective type of collateral."|198

methodology."|100
1463|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 126|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.2 Model development in LGD estimation > 6.2.2 Eligibility of collaterals|"126. Institutions should take into account as a risk driver or segmentation criterion information 
on all main types of collaterals that are used within the scope of application of the LGD 
model. Institutions should clearly define in their internal policies the main and other types of 
collaterals used for the type of exposures covered by the rating system and should ensure 
that, to the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, the 
policies regarding the management of these types of collateral comply with the requirement 
of Article 181(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Institutions should specify the main types 
of collaterals in such a way that the cash flows from the remaining types of collaterals will not 
significantly bias the estimation of recoveries that are realised without the use of collaterals."|205

575/2013 cannot be included as a risk driver in the LGD estimation and the cash flows 
received from those collaterals should be treated as if they had been received without the 
use of collaterals. Regardless of this treatment in the LGD estimation, institutions should 
collect the information about the source of the cash flows related to those collaterals and 
allocate them as related to those collaterals. Institutions should regularly monitor the levels 
of such cash flows as well as the extent to which the relevant types of collaterals are used. 
Where necessary, institutions should perform appropriate adjustments in order to avoid any 
bias in the LGD estimates."|192

1466|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 129|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.2 Model development in LGD estimation > 6.2.3 Inclusion of collaterals in the LGD estimation|"129. The approach developed by institutions to include the effect of collaterals in the LGD 
estimation should meet all of the following conditions: 
(a) institutions should avoid the bias that may stem from including the cash flows related to 
realisation of collateral in the estimation of recoveries that are realised without the use of 
collaterals and vice versa; 
(b) where institutions estimate separate recovery rates for specific types of collaterals, they 
should avoid a bias that may stem from including in the estimation sample the 
observations where the exposure was secured by only a part of the value of the collateral. 
For this purpose institutions should take reasonable steps to obtain the data on the total 
value of the collateral and total sale price of the collateral and include this information in 
the estimation where it is available; 
(c) where institutions estimate separate recovery rates for specific types of collaterals they 
should recognise and include in this estimation direct costs related to the collection on 
each of these specific types of collaterals separately as well; 
(d) where institutions estimate separate recovery rates for specific types of collaterals they 
should include in this estimation all recoveries realised from a specific type of collateral 
including those realised on exposures where the realisation of the collateral has been 
completed but the overall recovery process has not yet been closed; 
(e) where the same collateral covers several exposures, institutions should specify an 
adequate allocation methodology in order to avoid double counting of collaterals; the 
allocation methodology should be consistent between the LGD estimation and the 
application of LGD estimates and with the methodology used for accounting purposes; 
(f) the estimates should not be based solely on the estimated market value of the collateral 
but they should also take into account the realised recoveries from past liquidations and 
the potential inability of an institution to gain control and liquidate the collateral. For this 
purpose, institutions should take into account in the estimation those historical 
observations where the collateral could not be realised or where the recovery process 
was longer than expected, due to inability or difficulty to gain control or liquidate the 
collateral. Where institutions estimate the recovery rates related to specific types of 
collaterals, they should take into account the time between the moment of default and 
the time when the cash flows related to the collection on these types of collaterals have 
been received and should include in the estimation those observations where the 
collateral has not been realised as a result of inability to gain control; 
(g) the estimates should take into account the potential decreases in collateral value from 
the point of LGD estimation to the eventual recovery, in particular those resulting from 
changes in the market conditions, the state and age of the collateral and, where relevant, 
currency fluctuations. Where institutions have experienced decreases in values of 
collaterals and these are already reflected in observed recoveries, no further adjustments 
to the LGD estimates based on these observations should be made. Where potential 
decreases in values of collaterals are not reflected in historical observations or where 
institutions predict further, potentially more severe decreases in the future, they should 
be included in the quantification of LGD estimates by means of an appropriate 
adjustment based on forward-looking expectations. However, the LGD estimates should 
not be adjusted to take into account any potential increases in collateral value; 
(h) the estimates should take into account in a conservative manner the degree of 
dependence between the risk of the obligor and the risk of the diminishing value of the 
collateral as well as the cost of liquidating the collateral."|772

such a manner that individual grades are sufficiently homogeneous with respect to loss 
characteristics."|108

including them in the outstanding amount of the credit obligation at the moment of default in 
the numerator and denominator of the realised LGD. Where the fees were extended to the 
obligor in order to recover direct costs already incurred by the institution and these costs are 
already included in the calculation of the economic loss, institutions should not add these 
amounts to the economic loss or outstanding amount again. Any fees capitalised after the

exposures from the moment of default that reflects the expected period of time observed on 
the closed recovery processes during which the institution realises the vast majority of the 
recoveries, without taking into account the outlier observations with significantly longer 
recovery processes. The maximum period of the recovery processes should be specified in a 
way that ensures sufficient data for the estimation of the recoveries within this period for the 
incomplete recovery processes. The length of the maximum period of the recovery processes 
may be different for different types of exposures. The specification of the maximum period of 
the recovery process should be clearly documented and supported by evidence of the 
observed recovery patterns, and should be coherent with the nature of the transactions and 
the type of exposures. Specification of the maximum period of the recovery process for the 
purpose of the long-run average LGD should not prevent institutions from taking recovery 
actions where necessary, even with regard to exposures which remain in default for a period 
of time longer than the maximum period of the recovery process specified for this type of 
exposures."|275
1494|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 157|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.3 LGD calibration > 6.3.2 Long-run average LGD > 6.3.2.3 Treatment of incomplete recovery processes|"157. For the purpose of the calculation of the observed average LGD, institutions should 
recognise without undue delay as closed recovery processes all exposures in default which fall 
into at least one of the following categories: 
(a) exposures for which the institution does not expect to take any further recovery actions; 
(b) exposures that remain in defaulted status for a period of time longer than the maximum 
period of the recovery process specified for this type of exposures; 
(c) exposures fully repaid or written-off; 
(d) exposures that have been reclassified to non-defaulted status. 

With regard to the defaulted exposures falling under the categories in points (a) and (b), all 
recoveries and costs realised before or at the time of estimation should be considered for the 
purpose of the calculation of the observed average LGD, including any recoveries realised 
after the maximum period of the recovery processes."|223

LGD taking into account the information related to processes that were not closed 
(‘incomplete recovery processes’) and where the time from the moment of default until the 
moment of estimation is shorter than the maximum period of the recovery process specified 
for this type of exposures. For these processes, institutions should comply with both of the 
following: 
(a) they should take into account all observed costs and recoveries; 
(b) they may estimate future costs and recoveries, both those stemming from the realisation 
of the existing collaterals and those to be realised without the use of collaterals within the 
maximum period of the recovery processes."|188

principles: 
(a) for the purpose of estimation of the future costs and recoveries institutions should 
analyse the costs and recoveries realised on these exposures until the moment of 
estimation, in comparison with the average costs and recoveries realised during a similar 
period of time on similar exposures; for this purpose institutions should analyse the 
recovery patterns observed on both closed and incomplete recovery processes, taking 
into account only costs and recoveries realised up to the moment of estimation; 
(b) the assumptions underlying the expected future costs and recoveries as well as the 
adjustment to the observed average LGD should be: 
i. proven accurate through back-testing; 
ii. based on a reasonable economic rationale; 
iii. proportionate, taking into consideration that LGD estimates should be based on 
the long-run average LGD that reflects the average LGDs weighted by the number 
of defaults using all defaults observed during a historical observation period. 
(c) in estimating the future recoveries institutions should take into account the potential bias 
stemming from incomplete recovery processes being characterised by longer average 
recovery processes or lower average recoveries than closed recovery processes; 
(d) in estimating the future recoveries stemming from the realisation of the existing 
collaterals institutions should take into account the legal certainty of the claims on the 
collateral and realistic assumptions regarding the possibility of its realisation; 
(e) the adjustment of the observed average LGD may be estimated at the level of individual 
exposures, at the level of grade or pool or at the level of portfolio covered by the LGD 
model; 
(f) any uncertainty related to the estimation of the future recoveries on incomplete recovery 
processes should be reflected in an adequate MoC applied in accordance with section 4.4."|426

Where institutions observe that they realised profit on their observations of defaults, the 
realised LGD on these observations should equal zero for the purpose of calculation of the 
observed average LGD and the estimation of the long-run average LGD. Institutions may use

1498|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 161|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.3 LGD calibration > 6.3.3 Calibration to the long-run average LGD|"161. Institutions should calibrate their LGD estimates to the long run average LGD calculated in 
accordance with section 6.3.2. For this purpose institutions should choose a calibration 
method that is appropriate for their LGD estimation methodology from the following 
approaches: 
(a) the calibration of LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD calculated for each grade or 
pool, in which case they should provide additional calibration tests at the level of the 
relevant calibration segment; 
(b) the calibration of LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD calculated at the level of 
calibration segment, in particular where they use direct LGD estimates in accordance with 
Article 169(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including where they use LGD estimation 
methodology based on intermediate parameters. In this case institutions should at least 
compare this long-run average LGD with the average LGD estimate applied to the same 
set of observations as those used for calculating the long-run average LGD and, where 
necessary, correct the individual LGD estimates for the application portfolio accordingly, 
for instance by using a scaling factor. Where realised values are higher than estimated 
values at the level of calibration segment, institutions should correct the estimates 
upwards or readjust their estimation in order to reflect their loss experience."|305
1499|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 162|LGD modelling|6 LGD estimation > 6.3 LGD calibration > 6.3.3 Calibration to the long-run average LGD|"162. Where institutions observe extremely high values of realised LGDs much above 100%, 
especially for exposures with small outstanding amounts at the moment of default, they

recovery pattern through time; 
(b) a relevant date associated with a specific event at which significant breaks in the recovery

rating and PD or LGD assignment is reviewed as soon as possible; 
(b) where the new information relates to the default of an obligor, that the PD of the obligor 
is set to 1 in all relevant IT systems in a timely manner and in accordance with paragraph 
108 of the Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of 
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."|170
1532|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 195|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.1 Conservatism in the application of risk parameters|"195. For the purpose of Article 171(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should apply 
additional conservatism to the outcomes of the rating assignment where any deficiencies are 
identified related to the implementation of the model in the IT system or to the process of 
assignment of risk parameters to obligors or facilities in the current portfolio (application of 
risk parameters), especially when those deficiencies relate to data used in the rating 
assignment process. They should do so by establishing a framework that consists of the 
following phases: 
(a) identification of deficiencies of implementation of the model in the IT system or 
application of risk parameters; 
(b) specification of the form of conservatism to be applied and quantification of the 
appropriate level of conservatism; 
(c) monitoring of the deficiencies and correcting them; 
(d) documentation."|190
1533|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 196|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.1 Conservatism in the application of risk parameters|"196. For the purpose of paragraph 195(a) institutions should have a robust process for 
identifying all implementation and application deficiencies in the assignment process, 
whereby each deficiency leads to additional conservative treatment in the affected 
assignment to a grade or pool. Institutions should consider at least the following triggers for 
additional conservatism: 
(a) missing data in the application portfolio; 
(b) missing updates of financial statements or credit bureau data as referred to in paragraph 
59(h); 
(c) outdated ratings in the application portfolio; where outdated rating should be understood 
as specified in Article 25(2)(b) of the RTS on IRB methodology; 
(d) missing ratings, whereby an exposure is considered as being within the scope of 
application of the IRB model but is not rated by it."|182
1534|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 197|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.1 Conservatism in the application of risk parameters|"197. For the purpose of paragraph 195(b) institutions should ensure that the occurrence of any 
of the triggers referred to in paragraph 196 results in the application of additional 
conservatism to the risk parameter for the purpose of the calculation of risk-weighted 
exposure amounts. Where more than one trigger occurs, the estimate should be more 
conservative. The additional conservatism related to each trigger should be proportionate to 
the uncertainty in the estimated risk parameter introduced by the trigger."|118
1535|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 198|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.1 Conservatism in the application of risk parameters|"198. Institutions should consider the overall impact of the identified deficiencies and the 
resulting conservatism at the level of portfolio covered with the relevant model on the 
soundness of the assignments to grades or pools and ensure that the own funds requirements 
are not distorted by the necessity of excessive adjustments."|77
1536|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 199|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.1 Conservatism in the application of risk parameters|"199. For the purpose of paragraph 195(c) institutions should regularly monitor the 
implementation and application deficiencies and the levels of additional conservatism applied 
in relation to them. Whenever possible, institutions should take steps to address the 
identified deficiencies. Following its assessment, the institution should develop a plan to 
rectify the deficiencies within a reasonable timeframe, taking into consideration the 
magnitude of the impact on the own funds requirements."|103
1537|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 200|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.1 Conservatism in the application of risk parameters|"200. For the purpose of paragraph 195(d) institutions should specify adequate manuals and 
procedure for applying additional conservatism and should document the process applied in 
addressing implementation and application deficiencies. Such documentation should contain 
at least the triggers considered and the effects that the activation of such triggers had on the 
final assignment to a grade or pool, the level of risk parameter and on the own funds 
requirements."|101
1538|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 201|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.2 Human judgement in the application of risk parameters|"201. Institutions may use human judgement in the application of the model in the following 
cases: 
(a) in the application of the qualitative variables used within the model; 
(b) via overrides of the inputs of the rating assignment process; 
(c) via overrides of the outputs of the rating assignment process."|81
1539|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 202|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.2 Human judgement in the application of risk parameters|"202. Institutions should specify clear criteria for the use of qualitative model inputs and they 
should ensure a consistent application of such inputs by all relevant personnel and a 
consistent assignment of obligors or facilities posing similar risk to the same grade or pool as 
required by Article 171(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."|91
1540|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 203|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.2 Human judgement in the application of risk parameters|"203. For the purpose of Article 172(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should 
specify the policies and criteria for the use of overrides in the rating assignment process. 
These policies should refer both to possible overrides of inputs and outputs of such process 
and should be specified in a conservative manner such that the scale of conservative 
overrides should not be limited. In contrast, the scale of potential decreases of the estimates 
resulting from the model, either by overriding the inputs or outputs of the rating assignment 
process, should be limited. In applying the overrides institutions should take into account all 
relevant and up-to-date information."|154
1541|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 204|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.2 Human judgement in the application of risk parameters|"204. Institutions should document the scale and rationale of each override. Wherever possible 
institutions should specify a predefined list of possible justifications of the overrides to 
choose from. Institutions should also store information on the date of override and the 
person that performed and approved it."|75
1542|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 205|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.2 Human judgement in the application of risk parameters|"205. Institutions should regularly monitor the level and justifications for overrides of inputs 
and outputs of the rating assignment process. They should specify in their policies the 
maximum acceptable rate of overrides for each model. Where those maximum levels are 
breached, adequate measures should be taken by the institution. The rates of overrides 
should be specified and monitored at the level of calibration segment. Where there is a high 
number of overrides institutions should adopt adequate measures to improve the model."|114
1543|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 206|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.2 Human judgement in the application of risk parameters|"206. Institutions should regularly analyse the performance of exposures in relation to which 
an override of input or output of the rating assignment process has been performed in 
accordance with Article 172(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."|72
1544|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 207|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.2 Human judgement in the application of risk parameters|"207. Institutions should regularly assess the performance of the model before and after the 
overrides of outputs of the rating assignment process. Where the assessment concludes that 
the use of overrides significantly decreased the model’s capacity to accurately quantify the 
risk parameters (‘predictive power of the model’), institutions should adopt adequate 
measures to ensure the correct application of overrides."|92
1545|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 208|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.3 Use of internal ratings and default and loss estimates|"208. In accordance with Article 144(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Articles 18 to 21 
of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology institutions should use the same estimates of risk

including risk management and decision-making processes, unless all of the following 
conditions are met: 
(a) the deviation is justified and appropriate for the specific area of use; 
(b) the deviation does not lead to a change in rank ordering in the assignment of obligors or 
facilities to grades and pools within a calibration segment other than within each grade or 
pool; 
(c) the deviation is due to the use of parameters for internal purposes without consideration 
of the MoC, without regulatory floors, without downturn adjustment in the case of LGD 
estimates or is due to the use of a different calibration method, which may entail 
specifying different calibration segments."|220
1546|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 209|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.3 Use of internal ratings and default and loss estimates|"209. For the purpose of paragraph 208 it may also be considered adequate to group 
continuous risk parameter estimates into homogenous ranks for internal purposes."|50
1547|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 210|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.3 Use of internal ratings and default and loss estimates|"210. Where institutions use for internal purposes estimates of risk parameters that are 
different from those used in the calculation of own funds requirements they should 
periodically reflect this in their internal reporting to senior management by providing 
information on both sets of parameters. In any case internal reporting should include all 
elements specified in Article 189(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 based on the estimates of 
risk parameters used for the purpose of calculation of own funds requirements."|118

1551|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 214|Model application, use, review and changes|8 Application of risk parameters > 8.4 Calculation of IRB shortfall or excess|"214. For the purposes of Article 159 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 institutions should not 
include partial write-offs in the calculation of general and specific credit risk adjustments. 
However, as per Article 166(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the calculation of the 
expected loss amount for the application of Articles 158 and 159 of Regulation (EU) No

1552|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 215|Model application, use, review and changes|9 Review of estimates|"215. Institutions should specify internal policies for changes of models and estimates of risk 
parameters used within a rating system. Such policies should provide that changes in the 
models should be made as a result of at least the following: 
(a) regular review of estimates; 
(b) independent validation; 
(c) changes in the legal environment; 
(d) internal audit review; 
(e) competent authority review."|87
1553|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 216|Model application, use, review and changes|9 Review of estimates|"216. Where material deficiencies are identified as a result of the procedures referred to in 
paragraph 215 institutions should take appropriate actions depending on the severity of the 
deficiency and apply a MoC in accordance with section 4.4.3."|55
1554|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 217|Model application, use, review and changes|9 Review of estimates|"217. For the purpose of regular reviews of estimates, institutions should have a framework in 
place which includes at least the following elements: 
(a) a minimum scope and frequency of analyses to be performed, including predefined 
metrics chosen by the institution to test data representativeness, model performance, its 
predictive power and stability; 
(b) predefined standards, including predefined thresholds and significance levels for the 
relevant metrics; 
(c) predefined actions to be taken in case of adverse results of the review, depending on the 
severity of the deficiency. 
In their regular reviews of estimates institutions may rely on the results of independent 
validation where such results are up to date."|141
1555|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 218|Model application, use, review and changes|9 Review of estimates|"218. The reviews of estimates to be performed at least annually in accordance with Article 
179(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should be performed taking into account the 
metrics, standards and thresholds defined by the institution in accordance with paragraph 
217. The scope of such reviews should comprise at least the following elements: 
(a) an analysis of data representativeness, including all of the following: 
(i) an analysis of potential differences between the RDS used to quantify the risk 
parameter and the application portfolio, including the analysis of any changes in 
the portfolio or any structural breaks, in the manners of analysing the 
representativeness described in section 4.2.4; 
(ii) an analysis of potential differences between the RDS used to develop the model 
and the application portfolio; for this purpose institutions should: 
. perform the analysis set out in paragraphs 24, 25, and 26; 
. consider that data used for model development is sufficiently 
representative in terms of points (a) and (b) of paragraph 21 if the 
performance of the model in the sense of paragraph 218(b) is sound; 
. perform the analysis set out in paragraphs 22 and 23 where the 
performance of the model in the sense of paragraph 218(b) is 
deteriorating; 
(b) an analysis of the performance of the model and its stability over time, which should have 
both of the following characteristics: 
(i) the analysis should identify any potential deterioration of the model 
performance, including the model’s discriminatory power, through the 
comparison of its performance at the time of the development against its 
performance on each subsequent observation period of the extended data set as 
well as against the predefined thresholds; this analysis should be performed on 
relevant subsets, for instance with and without delinquency status in the case of 
PD estimates, or for various recovery scenarios in the case of LGD estimates; 
(ii) the analysis should be performed with regard to the whole application portfolio, 
without any data adjustments or exclusions performed in model development; 
for comparison purposes, the performance at the time of development should 
also be obtained for the whole application portfolio, prior to any data 
adjustments or exclusions; 
(c) an analysis of the predictive power of the model, including at least: 
(i) an analysis of whether the inclusion of the most recent data in the dataset used 
to estimate risk parameters leads to materially different risk estimates and in 
particular: 
. for PD, whether including the most recent data leads to a significant 
change in the long-run average default rate; this analysis should take into 
account the appropriate redefinition of the period of likely range of 
variability of default rates and of the mix of good and bad years, if 
necessary; 
. for LGD, whether including the most recent data leads to a significant 
change in the long-run average LGD or downturn LGD; 
(ii) a back-testing analysis, which should include a comparison of the estimates used 
for the calculation of own funds requirements against observed outcomes for 
each grade or pool; for this purpose institutions may take into account the results 
of back-testing performed as part of the internal validation in accordance with 
Article 185(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or they may perform additional 
tests, for instance with regard to a different timeframe of the dataset."|716
1556|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 219|Model application, use, review and changes|9 Review of estimates|"219. Institutions should specify conditions under which the analyses referred to in paragraph 
218 should be performed more frequently than annually, such as major changes in the risk

conditions as compared with the economic conditions underlying the dataset used for the 
purpose of model development."|89
1557|EBA Guidelines for PD and LGD estimation|Paragraph 220|Model application, use, review and changes|9 Review of estimates|"220. For the purpose of performing the tasks referred to in Article 190(2) of Regulation (EU) No

quantification of risk parameters and, where applicable, the estimation of model 
components. This review should include all of the following: 
(a) a review of the existing and potential risk drivers and an assessment of their significance 
based on the predefined standards of review referred to in paragraph 217; 
(b) an assessment of the modelling approach, its conceptual soundness, the fulfilment of the

Executive summary|These guidelines (GL) specify how loss given default (LGD) appropriate for an economic downturn, which has been identified in accordance with the final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on economic downturn, should be quantified. They supplement the Guidelines on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted assets (EBA/GL/2017/16) of 20/11/2017 (GL on PD and LGD estimation) and provide specific guidance on how to estimate LGD appropriate for an economic downturn.|110
1560|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph These GL are hence an addendum to the GL on PD and LGD estimation, which are part of the European Banking Authority's (EBA's) roadmap to reduce unwarranted variability of risk parameters and own funds requirements|Downturn LGD estimation|1. Executive summary|These GL are hence an addendum to the GL on PD and LGD estimation, which are part of the European Banking Authority's (EBA's) roadmap to reduce unwarranted variability of risk parameters and own funds requirements. As such, this publication completes the plan outlined in the report on the review of the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach published in February 2016. The policy for downturn LGD estimation builds on the notion of an economic downturn that is specified in the final draft regulatory technical standards on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn in accordance with Articles 181(3)(a) and 182(4)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), published on 16 November 2018.|164
1561|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph The RTS on economic downturn set out the requirements for the identification of an economic downturn for the type of exposures covered by a rating system|Downturn LGD estimation|1. Executive summary|"The RTS on economic downturn set out the requirements for the identification of an economic downturn for the type of exposures covered by a rating system. As a rating system may, however, cover exposures from different businesses, sectors and geographical areas, the notion of an economic downturn set forth in the RTS may comprise several distinct downturn periods. The GL for downturn LGD estimation provide guidance on how to calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for an economic downturn, taking into account the downturn period(s) identified in accordance with the RTS. To this end, the GL differentiate three types of approaches for calibrating downturn LGD:
(i) type 1 approaches, based on the observed impact on losses of a particular downturn period;
(ii) type 2 approaches, where such an impact on losses has not been observed (e.g. because the downturn periods identified in accordance with the RTS have occurred too long ago) but the impact can be estimated using a limited set of methodologies;
(iii) type 3 approaches, where neither type 1 nor type 2 approaches can be applied and therefore institutions may apply their preferred modelling approach but have to comply with a minimum margin of conservatism (MoC) requirement."|241
1562|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph Although the downturn LGD estimates should optimally be quantified based on the observed loss data, this approach is permitted only where relevant and sufficient loss data to analyse the observed impact of the downturn period under consideration are available|Downturn LGD estimation|1. Executive summary|Although the downturn LGD estimates should optimally be quantified based on the observed loss data, this approach is permitted only where relevant and sufficient loss data to analyse the observed impact of the downturn period under consideration are available. If this is the case, downturn LGDs should be quantified based on observed data reflecting the impact of the downturn period under consideration. However, if no loss data are available to calibrate downturn LGD for a particular downturn period based on observed data, it may be possible to estimate the impact on the losses of this downturn period. Therefore, in the latter case institutions are required to calibrate downturn LGD through more prescriptive approaches. Two methodologies are allowed in this case, namely the extrapolation and haircut approaches (or a combination of the two). Under both methodologies and in line with paragraphs 37, 42 and 43 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, an appropriate MoC to cover for the lack of data (Category A MoC) will in addition be required. Finally, a third approach is available in cases where no relevant loss data are available for the downturn periods under consideration and institutions can justify to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that they cannot apply the extrapolation and/or haircut approach or a combination of the two. In this case, institutions may apply their preferred modelling approach, but have to add MoC to cover for the methodological and data deficiencies, such that the downturn LGD estimates including MoC are equal or higher than the long-run average LGD plus 15 percentage points, capped at 105%.|319
1563|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph Last, a reference value is introduced that acts as a non-binding challenger to the final downturn LGD estimation and as a guide for the supervisory assessment of the appropriateness of the resulting quantification|Downturn LGD estimation|1. Executive summary|Last, a reference value is introduced that acts as a non-binding challenger to the final downturn LGD estimation and as a guide for the supervisory assessment of the appropriateness of the resulting quantification. This means that the reference value acts as a challenger to the whole downturn LGD estimation, including the proper identification of the downturn period(s) pursuant to the RTS on economic downturn.|81

Executive summary|The guidelines will support the appropriate quantification of downturn LGD. Like the GL on PD and LGD estimation, it is expected that these GL will lead to material model changes for a significant number of rating systems. In this context, it should be recalled that these GL are an addendum to the GL on PD and LGD estimation and that therefore the proposed phasing-in approach, as well as the deadline of at latest end-2020 for the final implementation, set out in the EBA's Opinion on the implementation of the review of the IRB approach, published by EBA in February 2016, will apply.|131
1566|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 1|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction|1. The quantification of downturn LGD has been challenging for competent authorities, industry and academics alike ever since the Basel II framework introduced this concept. The requirement for loss given default (LGD) and conversion factor (CF) estimates to reflect economic downturn conditions was introduced in the Basel II capital framework and stems from the general economic model that is used to derive the formula for calculating minimum own funds requirements. In the Basel II capital framework, unexpected losses are based on the conditional expected loss given a high confidence level for the single systematic risk factor leading to high credit losses. Whereas the risk weight formula includes a supervisory mapping function to derive conditional probabilities of default (PDs) from unconditional long-run average PDs estimated by the institutions, it does not provide an explicit function that would transform long-run average LGDs and exposures at default (EADs) into conditional LGDs and exposure values (respectively CFs). Instead, it requires institutions to use LGDs that are appropriate for an economic downturn. The lack of explicit guidance and limited supervisory and industry consensus on how to incorporate the economic downturn component in model estimation has led to significant differences in practices and has given rise to unwarranted variability in risk-weighted exposure (RWE) amounts when own estimates of LGDs and/or CFs are used.|275
1567|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 2|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction|2. These guidelines (GL) understand downturn LGD estimation as an aspect of risk parameter quantification - in line with the specification of the respective requirements in Sub-Section 2, Section 6, Chapter 3 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR). This implies, most importantly, that the quantification of downturn LGD should refer to the same LGD model used for the assignment of facilities to facility grades or pools that is relevant to the long-run average LGD estimation. Thus, it is expected that the assignment to facility grades and pools within a given calibration segment should not change due to downturn LGD estimation. These GL do not apply to CF estimation appropriate for an economic downturn.|158
1568|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 3|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Context of downturn LGD estimation|3. In general terms, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is fully supportive of allowing a diversity of model practices. The strength of internal models lies in the ability of institutions to model on institution-specific data, which ensures a high degree of risk sensitivity and constitutes an important characteristic of own funds requirements that should be maintained. It is, however, also clear that this requires sufficiently granular data and specific guidance on the calibration targets. In this context, these guidelines focus on the calibration target, i.e. LGDs appropriate for an economic downturn (downturn LGDs), and not the calibration methodology applied to ensure that the calibration target is met. Therefore, the proposed policy leaves flexibility with respect to the actual estimation methodology but provides guidance on the types of approaches to be used for the quantification of the calibration target.|184
1569|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 4|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Context of downturn LGD estimation|4. Because of this understanding, the level at which downturn LGDs are calibrated should be at least the same as the level at which long-run average LGDs are calculated for the purpose of calibration. In this context, it should be recalled that the GL on PD and LGD estimation define the notion of 'calibration segments' as a uniquely identified subset of the range of application of the LGD model that is jointly calibrated. The use of calibration segments does not, however, require institutions to calibrate LGDs at the level of calibration segments. Institutions may use calibration segments but calibrate LGD estimates at the level of each grade or pool (e.g. if, in the step of calibration, the portfolio under consideration is split by certain regions) within those calibration segments. However, regardless of whether an institution calculates the long- run average LGD at the level of calibration segments or at the level of grades or pools, both with the objective of providing LGD estimates by facility grade or pool, the quantification of downturn LGD estimates should follow the level considered by the institution for the purpose of calibrating LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD.|254

In line with the aspects covered by the CRR in the context of quantification of risk parameters, these GL provide, in addition, requirements on MoC related to downturn LGD estimation. Issues of representativeness have not been addressed, as these are covered by subsection 4.2.4 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation.

1571|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 6|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Terminology used in these guidelines|6. The CRR sets out requirements on risk quantification in Section 6, Sub-Section 2 (Articles 178- 184 of the CRR). This sub-section in the CRR covers aspects including representativeness, MoC and parameter estimations per grade or pool that lead to the quantification of the final parameters being applied in calculating RWE amounts. The CRR refers to parameter estimation where rules for quantification of PD and LGD estimates are set out (e.g. Article 180 of the CRR).|128
1572|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 7|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Terminology used in these guidelines|7. The term 'calibration target' is not used in the CRR. However, where it is used in this section it refers to the value that is considered for the purpose of calibration in accordance with paragraph 161 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. It should be noted that the specification of a calibration target in this sense and the estimation might coincide where institutions use LGD models (in the sense of Article 174 of the CRR) that assign exposures to facility grades or pools without providing for individual estimates of loss. In this case, the LGD model just provides a grading or pooling of facilities, and the calibration target (e.g. long-run average LGD per facility grade and pool) coincides with the estimation of LGD per facility grade and pool. As stated earlier, the quantification of LGD or downturn LGD covers, in addition, the application of an appropriate MoC.|205

Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Terminology used in these guidelines|"8. In this context, it should be noted that the GL on PD and LGD estimation define the estimation of risk parameters as including risk differentiation and risk quantification, and that in this sense these GL on downturn LGD treat only the risk quantification part of downturn LGD estimation. The GL on PD and LGD envisage this interpretation of downturn LGD estimate by defining LGD calibration as:
The part of the process of the estimation of risk parameters which leads to appropriate risk quantification by ensuring that the LGD estimates correspond to the long-run average LGD, or to the downturn LGD estimate where this is more conservative, at the level relevant for the applied method."|156
1574|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 9|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Terminology used in these guidelines|"9. In order to improve clarity in the GL text where it refers to the calibration target used for downturn LGD estimation and where it refers to the downturn LGD estimates by facility grade or pool, the following terminology is used throughout the text:
Quantification of downturn LGD: the term quantification of downturn LGD covers all elements of the quantification of downturn LGD including the quantification of the calibration target, the quantification of the resulting downturn LGD estimates at grade and pool level and the quantification of MoC.
Calibration of downturn LGD: the term calibration of downturn LGD in the context of these GL refers to the quantification of the calibration target at the relevant level. Please note that some requirements for the calibration of downturn LGD require the quantification and recognition of MoC to be added to the final estimates at the level of grades and pools.
Downturn LGD estimates: these are the LGD estimates appropriate for an economic downturn at the grade or pool level after calibration and before the application of MoC. These will generally be the best estimates. They are referred to only in the plural."|247

Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Three approaches to downturn LGD calibration|10. The centrepiece of the GL provides the policy for quantification of the calibration target for downturn LGD for one specific downturn period. However, the final RTS on economic downturn provides a notion of an economic downturn that might comprise several distinct downturn periods. Where more than one downturn period is identified, these GL specify that the downturn LGD has to be calibrated for each of those periods. The final downturn LGDs used for the calculation of capital requirements should then relate to the single downturn period leading to the highest average LGD (on a calibration segment) if the resulting estimates plus MoC are applied to the current non-defaulted portfolio at the time of calibration.|154

Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Three approaches to downturn LGD calibration|11. In line with the general principle of the internal ratings-based approach that the quantification of risk parameters should be based on observed data, the calibration of downturn LGD should be based on the observed impact of the downturn period on the relevant losses, where possible, and, where not, it should make use of certain methodologies. The GL therefore differentiate between three approaches, introduced in paragraphs 23 to 25, which are increasing in prescriptiveness and with regard to aspects that need to be covered by appropriate MoC:|125
1577|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph i|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Three approaches to downturn LGD calibration|i. Type 1: downturn LGD calibration based on observed impact. Where sufficient (in terms of timespan covered and quantity of data, to arrive at stable estimates) loss data are available to assess the impact for the downturn period under consideration, which has been identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn, the institution should conduct a standardised impact assessment with a prescriptive minimum scope. The impact assessment requires that institutions analyse whether there is evidence of elevated realised LGDs, decreased annual recoveries, decreased number of cures (i.e. exposures that defaulted and returned to non-defaulted status) or prolonged time in default caused by the downturn period under consideration. Downturn LGD should then be calibrated for the downturn period under consideration in a way that it is coherent with the results obtained from that impact assessment, i.e. the institution is required to consider the results of the impact assessment and to model appropriately the loss components materially affected by the downturn period under consideration.|215
1578|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph ii|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Three approaches to downturn LGD calibration|ii. Type 2: downturn LGD calibration based on estimated impact using historical loss data (haircut or extrapolation approach or a combination of the two). Where loss data are not available to base the downturn LGD calibration on an observed impact for a considered downturn period, the downturn LGD should be calibrated using a haircut approach or an extrapolation approach. The approaches may also be combined and be used for the downturn calibration of intermediate risk parameters (such as recovery rates or cure rates) and risk drivers.|121
1579|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph iii|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.1 Introduction > Three approaches to downturn LGD calibration|iii. Type 3: free modelling flexibility with minimum fixed add-on. Where sufficient data are not available to quantify downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration based on observed or estimated impact using the approaches outlined in points (i) and (ii) above, the institution still has to provide downturn LGD estimates, given the explicit requirement in the CRR. However, in this case, the estimates also need to fulfil a minimum level of MoC, covering the lack of data and methodological deficiencies. Moreover, the institution must justify to the satisfaction of the competent authority that it can apply neither the approach outlined in point (i) nor the approach outlined in point (ii) above. Under this third approach, it is required that the final downturn LGD estimates plus an appropriate MoC be higher than the corresponding long-run-average LGDs plus 15 percentage points (capped at a final downturn LGD estimate level of 105%).|208

1591|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 15|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.2 General requirements on downturn LGD estimation|"15. This means in particular that the concept of the MoC laid down in the GL on PD and LGD estimation should also be applied to downturn LGD estimation. Therefore, the MoC for downturn LGD estimation should be assessed in accordance with the requirements set out in subsection 4.4 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. In particular, this means that institutions should:
a. identify all deficiencies related to the estimation of downturn LGDs that may lead to a bias in the quantification of the estimates or to an increased uncertainty which is not captured by the general estimation error specifically related to the downturn LGD estimation in accordance with the guidance set out in subsection 4.4.1 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation;
b. apply appropriate adjustments (as described in subsection 4.4.2 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation) to overcome the identified deficiencies in order to provide a more accurate downturn LGD estimation; and
c. reflect the uncertainty of the downturn LGD estimation (including appropriate adjustments) by quantifying an MoC subdivided into three categories:
i. Category A: MoC related to data and methodological deficiencies identified under Category A as referred to in paragraph 36(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation;
ii. Category B: MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies and any other source of additional uncertainty identified under Category B as referred to in paragraph 36(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation; and
iii. Category C: MoC related to the general estimation error."|349
1592|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 16|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.2 General requirements on downturn LGD estimation|16. The GL clarify in paragraph 14(a) that downturn LGD should be calibrated at least at the same level as that at which the long-run average LGD is calculated for the purpose of calibrating LGD in accordance with paragraph 161 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. The rationale for this is that downturn LGD estimation should be understood as risk quantification of LGD estimates appropriate for an economic downturn, i.e. that the downturn LGD calibration just provides a different calibration target from long-run average LGD and sets out additional requirements regarding the applicable MoC. Thus, if an institution considers the long-run average LGDs by grades or pools (in line with paragraph 161(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation) with the objective of calibrating LGD estimates for these grades or pools, it needs to consider the same level for quantifying downturn LGD. If an institution considers long-run average LGDs calculated at the level of calibration segments for the purpose of LGD calibration (in line with Article 161(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation), it needs to quantify downturn LGDs for the purpose of downturn LGD calibration at least by calibration segment.|266
1593|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 17|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.2 General requirements on downturn LGD estimation|17. In addition paragraph 14(b) provides guidance on the use of calibration segments in downturn LGD estimation analogous to paragraph 97 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, which provides guidance on the use of calibration segments for PD estimation. An institution should identify subsets of the type of exposure under consideration as calibration segments, where exposures in these subsets are covered by the same LGD model for assignment to facility grades but on average show significantly different loss profiles, and where exposures in these subsets are affected differently by downturn periods. At a minimum, banks are required to consider material subsets of exposures covering different geographical areas/jurisdictions or industry sectors or, in the case of retail, product types as calibration segments. The rationale for this minimum requirement is that economic factors in the RTS are required to be customised to each relevant jurisdiction and sector. A typical example of where the use of calibration segments should be considered is the situation when an LGD model is rolled out to a different jurisdiction. The drivers for LGD might be the same in a different jurisdiction and thus the LGD model might provide a reasonable risk differentiation in a different jurisdiction, but the overall loss profile might be significantly different due to, for example, different legal processes in the context of collateral liquidation. It may, however, also turn out that loss characteristics and levels are independent from, for example, jurisdictions or industry sectors, in which case the differentiation of calibration segments might not be necessary.|311
1594|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 18|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.2 General requirements on downturn LGD estimation|18. The provision set out in paragraph 15 of the GL ensures that, as a general concept, an institution needs to estimate downturn LGDs appropriate to each downturn period identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn. As the approach in the RTS can lead to the identification of multiple downturn periods, institutions need to calibrate downturn LGD and provide the resulting LGD downturn estimates in relation to different downturn periods. Consequently, this may require institutions to calibrate downturn LGD based on different types of approaches (as described in section 2.5 of this Background and rationale), as loss data might be available for some identified downturn periods, but not for others.|151
1595|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 19|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.2 General requirements on downturn LGD estimation|"19. Given that, in the case of multiple downturn periods, institutions may have to use different approaches in order to set the calibration target, it is important to specify in detail how this interaction should work, which will in turn specify which final downturn LGD estimates should be selected. Therefore, three principles are laid down in the policy:
i. First, the proposed policy requires that the final downturn LGD estimates relate to one downturn period per calibration segment.
ii. Second, where for one of the downturn periods identified downturn LGD is calibrated using a type 3 approach and for another downturn period downturn LGD is calibrated using a type 1 or type 2 approach, then the latter shall be taken into account for the final LGD downturn estimates and an MoC needs to be added for the lack of analysis of one downturn period. In brief, downturn LGD estimation subject to the minimum add-on is disregarded where downturn LGD estimation is possible based on observed or estimated impact for any other downturn period subject to an additional appropriate MoC. Under no circumstances should this principle be abused to circumvent the obligatory use of type 2 approaches where their application is possible. Indeed, it is expected that type 3 approaches will be considered only in exceptional cases. Therefore, the waiver for downturn periods that require a type 3 approach as set out in paragraph 15(a)(iv) of the GL will be revised by the EBA, should there be indcations of excessive or misuse of this waiver.
iii. Third, where LGD estimates are quantified for several downturn periods, institutions should choose as the finally relevant downturn period the period that results in the highest average downturn LGD for the calibration segment under consideration. It is important to note that this refers to the average downturn LGD of the latest available snapshot of the current non-defaulted portfolio at the time of calibration."|396
1596|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 20|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.2 General requirements on downturn LGD estimation|20. The rationale for the first principle is that, where different calibration segments cover exposures from, for example, different jurisdictions, industry sectors or even product types for retail exposures, the multiple downturn periods will have different impacts on these calibration segments. The second principle is justified by the fact that the LGD estimates based on type 3 approaches are not based on observed or estimated impact on loss data and are therefore considered less reliable. The third principle ensures that the estimation is based on the downturn period that leads to the highest expected impact when applying the final downturn LGD estimation. In this context, it should be noted that theoretically an institution might have to apply a type 3 approach for several downturn periods and might not be able to quantify downturn LGD for any downturn periods based on a type 1 or type 2 approach. In this case, the second principle would not be applicable and the third principle would provide guidance for the choice of the finally relevant downturn period.|211

1605|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 22|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.2 General requirements on downturn LGD estimation|"22. Paragraph 15(b) of the GL lays down that, where institutions can provide evidence that a downturn period is not relevant to one of the calibration segments, that downturn period can
be disregarded for that calibration segment. For this purpose, institutions should provide evidence that the economic factors underlying the downturn period under consideration are not relevant to the calibration segment under consideration. This will be the case mainly when downturn periods are defined based on sectoral or industry-specific factors and the calibration segments are also defined in terms of sectors or industry segments. In these cases, the downturn period defined based on economic indicators related to industry A will not be relevant to the calibration segment related to industry B. However, if the downturn period is defined based on economic indicators related to both industries A and B, this will also be relevant to the calibration segment related to industry B. Thus, in Example 1 above, the downturn period 1990-1991 may be disregarded for calibration segment B, consisting of consumer credits and overdrafts, when properly justified."|228

Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|"24. The policy proposed in paragraph 16 of the GL provides guidance related to the first sentence of Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, which requires that institutions use LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average LGD (LRA). The GL clarify how this requirement should be interpreted in the context of calibration of downturn LGD. It should be noted, however, that this requirement to compare downturn and long-run average LGD used for calibration is without prejudice to the requirement in Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR to ensure that the actual downturn LGD estimates are used (in application) if they are more conservative than long-run average LGDs. In general, and technically speaking, downturn LGD may be calibrated in either of the following ways:
a) directly, independently of the long-run average LGD estimation or
b) by an adjustment to the long-run average LGD."|220
1608|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 25|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|"25. For the purpose of providing guidance on the CRR article in question, it seemed helpful to differentiate the two different technical approaches. In order to comply with the requirement that the higher of the long-run average and the downturn LGD estimate constitutes the final LGD estimate, paragraph 16 requires that the long-run average LGD plus the corresponding MoC be compared with the corresponding downturn LGD plus the corresponding MoC at the level relevant to the calibration. Although paragraph 14 allows downturn LGDs to be calibrated on a more granular level than the long-run average LGD, it is expected that generally the level of calibration for long-run average LGD and downturn LGD will be the same. In exceptional cases, however, where banks use a more granular level for the calibration of downturn LGD, institutions need to provide a meaningful aggregation in order to compare the downturn and long-run average LGDs used for calibration.
However, where a downturn adjustment is applied to the long-run average LGD, this requirement implies that the MoC applied to the final LGD estimate (i.e. LRA + downturn adjustment + MoC) needs to account for both (i) the uncertainty related to the estimation of long-run average LGD and (ii) the uncertainty related to the calculation of the downturn adjustment."|285

Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|26. Paragraph 17 of the GL relates to the second sentence of Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, which requires that institutions make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn if a rating system is expected to deliver realised LGDs at a constant level by grade or pool over time. The EBA considers that this provision is meant to ensure that the capital impact that stems from the migrations between facility grades and pools (e.g. in cases where risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle are used) does not lead over time to an over- or underestimation of the LGDs appropriate for an economic downturn. This provision, however, targets migrations caused by changes in the economic cycle. Structural changes over time in a portfolio under consideration (which might also be caused by changes in economic conditions, e.g. due to tightened underwriting standards) are a matter of representativeness and should be treated in accordance with section 4 of the GL on PD and LGD. This entails in particular that institutions should assume that no exposures would have been newly added to a calibration segment and that no exposures would have left a calibration segment due to orderly termination of the contract, when considering the likely distribution of the current portfolio affected by the relevant downturn period.|286
1612|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph As an example, a simplified LGD model for a retail mortgage portfolio with just one risk driver, in this case the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), could be considered|Downturn LGD estimation|2.

Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|27. In summary, Example 3 illustrates that, in cases of LGD models based on risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle, the impact on the current capital requirements of an upcoming economic upturn (or downturn) is twofold: (i) the impact stemming from the expected lower (or higher) realised economic losses per facility (in the event of a downturn, this is covered by the downturn LGD estimation by grade) and (ii) the impact stemming from the migrations of facilities to lower (or higher) LTV bands.|131
1621|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 28|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|28. It is indeed true that the loss rates in the higher LTV bands already reflect the expected realised LGDs under upcoming downturn conditions. The expected realised loss (in contrast to the loss rates) will, however, be higher, due to the higher proportion of facilities that migrate to the higher LTV bands.|84
1622|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 29|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|29. The provision in paragraph 17 serves the purpose of ensuring that those LGD models that are based on risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle appropriately estimate the economic loss (appropriate for an economic downturn) in the current state of the economic cycle at the time of calibration. The provision thus contains an expectation that for those LGD models an adjustment to the downturn LGDs should be applied that is higher in a favourable economic state of the economic cycle (at the time of calibration or recalibration) and smaller in an adverse state of the economic cycle (at the time of calibration or recalibration). If, however, the institution applies a downturn estimation methodology that incorporates this expectation (e.g. where the risk drivers are adjusted to reflect downturn conditions), then there is no need for additional adjustments. Indeed, the application of paragraph 17 of the GL should in no case lead to a double incorporation of the impact of an economic downturn. In this context, institutions should take into account that the underlying LGD model has to provide for sufficient homogeneity of exposures assigned to the same grades or pools in accordance with Article 38 of the RTS on assessment methodology.|251

Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|30. In this context, it should be recalled that section 9 of the GL on PD and LGD also applies to downturn LGD estimation and that in the light of paragraph 17 it might be necessary in the review of downturn LGD estimates to consider the effects of recent changes in the economic conditions on the current portfolio and where necessary recalibrate the final downturn LGD estimates.|98

Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|31. Paragraph 18 sets out the requirement to compare the resulting downturn LGD at the level of calibration segments (on the reference data set, RDS) with a reference value, which should be calculated following the rules set out in section 8 of the GL. The reference value is a challenger value; in the event of a material difference between the reference value and the downturn LGD estimates, this should be justified based on the guidance laid down in paragraph 19.|116
1625|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 32|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|32. In fact, the reference value can be driven by other issues than the impact of an economic downturn period (e.g. low number of defaults, changes in the portfolio composition, fraud or operational risk cases, or even natural disasters such as an earthquake). Even if the reference value is driven by an economic downturn period, the reference value itself should not be considered an appropriate quantification of downturn LGD (as it may not comply with all the requirements laid down in these GL). Therefore, specifically if downturn LGD estimation is based on type 1 approaches, institutions may use the evidence gathered from the impact assessment set out in paragraph 27 of the GL for the justification of the material difference. On the other hand, the selected years of the reference value might also point to a previously unidentified downturn period.|183

Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|33. It is important to stress the non-binding character of the reference value. In fact, as stated before, the reference value will generally not comply with the rules set out in these GL and should therefore not be used as a calibration target for downturn LGD estimation. In addition, it should be noted that the result of the re-assessment required by paragraph 19 may (and will in many cases) be that the downturn LGD estimation is appropriate.|113

Background and rationale > 2.3 Requirements that apply to the final downturn LGD estimates|34. The reference value is nevertheless considered to be a meaningful supervisory tool, which supports the supervisory assessment of the resulting downturn LGD estimates and can support institutions in understanding the dynamics of their realised LGDs over time.|66

Background and rationale > 2.4 Downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures|35. Section 4.2 of these GL provides guidance on the downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures. As a precondition to apply the policy laid down in this section, the institution should have identified the finally relevant downturn period per calibration segment for the non- defaulted exposures. As a general rule, for defaulted exposures, institutions should apply the GL for downturn LGD estimation for each reference date, but only in relation to the downturn period identified as relevant to the respective non-defaulted exposures. This will ensure that both LGD in default and LGD for non-defaulted exposures are based on the very same downturn period.|144

Background and rationale > 2.4 Downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures|36. As an exception, institutions may, for the purpose of estimating downturn LGD for defaulted exposures for a specific reference date, build on the estimation of downturn LGD at the time of default, if the institution can convincingly explain that this is a conservative estimate of downturn LGD in default for the specific reference date. In this context, it should be noted that the GL text in paragraph 21(b) refers to the downturn component for defaulted exposures at the moment of default. This is relevant, as in the event of partial write-offs at the moment of default the loss related to these write-offs will be relevant to the downturn LGD for non- defaulted exposure, but might not be taken into account for downturn LGD for defaulted exposure at the moment of default where compliant with paragraph 179 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation.|190

Moreover, it should be noted that the policy for downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures relies on paragraph 193 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, where it is clarified that the final LGD for defaulted exposure appropriate for economic downturn conditions should also include an appropriate MoC and where necessary potential additional unexpected losses during the recovery period referred to in Article 181(1)(h) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.|112

Background and rationale > 2.5 Downturn LGD estimation for one considered downturn period|39. The requirements in section 4.3 set out the rules of how downturn LGD estimates should be calibrated for one specific downturn period under consideration. Paragraphs 22 to 25 of these GL specify how the relevant approach for the quantification of the calibration target for downturn LGD should be chosen. Basically, if an institution has observed data to specify the impact of the downturn period under consideration on the institution's relevant loss data (which may also be external data), the downturn LGD should be calibrated based on the observed impact (i.e. section 5 should be applied). If, however, such observed data are not available, institutions should apply a type 2 methodology (i.e. the requirements in section 6 should apply). In exceptional cases where an institution can justify to the satisfaction of the competent authority that a type 2 approach cannot be applied, the institution should use a type 3 approach, as described earlier in this chapter.|214

Background and rationale > 2.5 Downturn LGD estimation for one considered downturn period|"40. Regardless of which of the approaches outlined above is used to quantify downturn LGD, there are two principles that institutions should take into account:
Principle 1:
“Where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on other parameters should be added where necessary.”"|128
1635|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 41|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.5 Downturn LGD estimation for one considered downturn period|41. The rationale for this principle is that it may be necessary under both type 1 as well as under type 2 approaches to aggregate the impact of a considered downturn period on different intermediate parameters, such as cure rate or recovery rate. The principle ensures that offsetting effects are not taken into account and provides more guidance related to the requirement that institutions should quantify downturn LGDs in a way that is coherent with the evidence found in the impact assessment for type 1 methodologies. The highest impact in this context should, for type 1 methodologies, refer to the highest relative change when comparing the evidence found in the impact assessment with the average value of each component.|154
1636|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 42|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.5 Downturn LGD estimation for one considered downturn period|"42. It should be noted that the principle only determines the starting point of the institution's considerations for the quantification of downturn LGD where impact on different components needs to be aggregated.
Principle 2:
“The downturn LGD estimates should not be biased by observed or estimated cash flows that are received with a significantly longer time lag than the period referred to in paragraph 156 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation and which might rather reflect an upturn or improved economic conditions following the considered downturn period.”"|124
1637|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 43|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.5 Downturn LGD estimation for one considered downturn period|43. The rationale for this principle is that in fact, where realised LGDs are computed with respect to the time of default but with long recovery processes, compensation effects might absorb a potential downturn impact. Indeed, it could be the case that, whereas the date of default reflected downturn conditions, the assets may be sold for a higher price once economic conditions have recovered - effectively leading to an economic loss reflecting economic upturn rather than downturn conditions.|110
1638|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph The requirement to add additional impact where necessary is meant to ensure that all impact observed or estimated on different components is covered by the final downturn LGD estimation|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.5 Downturn LGD estimation for one considered downturn period > Example 4|"The requirement to add additional impact where necessary is meant to ensure that all impact observed or estimated on different components is covered by the final downturn LGD estimation. One way of how institutions could ensure this in case of type 1 methodologies can be illustrated by the following simplified example:
Assume the institution found evidence of:
i. an increase of about 2% in realised LGDs due to the downturn period under consideration;
ii. a decrease of about 15% in annual recoveries due to the downturn period under consideration."|130

In order to comply with paragraph 28 (to provide a downturn LGD estimate coherent with the results of the impact assessment), the institution could transfer the observed decrease in annual recoveries as a result of the downturn period to all facilities in the reference data set (as defined in the EBA GL on PD and LGD) that were not affected by the downturn period, and recalculate downturn LGD. The resulting downturn LGD might already cover the impact observed on the realised LGDs. If not, the additional impact observed should be added. There are, however, other possible ways institutions could ensure that that all impact observed or estimated on different components is covered, e.g. the institution could choose a model for calibrating downturn LGD based on model components and set the level of the component under consideration to the impact observed or estimated and check whether the resulting downturn LGD estimates cover for the impact observed on realised LGD.|226

Background and rationale > 2.6 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact|44. It is worth noting that the guidance laid down in these GL builds on the general presumption of the advanced IRB approach (i.e. where the institution uses own estimates of LGDs) where risk parameters are quantified based on observed data. Therefore, as a first step and in line with the hierarchy of approaches, an institution needs to assess whether for a type of exposure under consideration sufficient loss data are available to assess the impact of a considered downturn period identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn. If that is the case, the institution follows the guidance for downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact laid down in this section.|149

Background and rationale > 2.6 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact|"45. In order to ensure that all relevant aspects of the economic loss calculated in accordance with subsection 6.3.1 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation are covered appropriately, the minimum components of such an impact assessment are prescribed in paragraph 27 of the GL. In detail, the proposed impact assessment requires institutions to analyse whether there is evidence of impact of the downturn period under consideration on the four following components, namely
(i) elevated realised LGDs; (ii) decreased annual recoveries; (iii) decreased number of facilities returned to non-defaulted status in a predefined time horizon, which should be appropriate for the type of exposure and reflect the usual time to cure; and (iv) prolonged time in default."|168

Background and rationale > 2.6 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact|46. Regarding the first two components, the required analysis touches upon the issue on whether the impact of an economic downturn should be considered with respect to the date of default or with respect to the date of receiving the material share of the recovery cash flows. On the one hand, considering the realised LGDs with respect to the time in default is more consistent with the calculation of RWE amounts, where the expected loss is expressed as the product of PD and LGD, i.e. implying that it refers to the same reference point in time. On the other hand, considering the impact on annual recoveries per source of cash flow (regardless of the dates of default) might better reflect the economic loss appropriate for an economic downturn. Indeed, it could be the case that, although the date of default reflected downturn conditions, collateral may be sold for a higher price once economic conditions have recovered - effectively leading to collateral prices reflecting economic upturn rather than downturn conditions. Because of these considerations, the proposed impact assessment requires both types of analyses in paragraph 27(a), points (i) and (ii).|241

Background and rationale > 2.6 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact|47. Moreover, for the analysis in paragraph 27(a)(i) the data need to be split into two subsets. One set should contain all facilities which have reached their maximum time to recovery as defined in paragraph 156 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation or which have been closed before they reached this point in time. The other set should contain all incomplete recovery processes that have not reached their maximum time to recovery. In a second step, evidence of impact of the downturn period under consideration should be analysed separately for the set containing complete recovery processes and those that have reached their maximum time to recovery, and for the set containing incomplete recovery processes. For the latter set, the impact on the recovery pattern for each vintage of default should be analysed and may provide input for, in particular, the downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposure.|189

Background and rationale > 2.6 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact|48. The analysis of the additional components set out in paragraph 27(a), points (iii) and (iv), namely the decreased number of facilities returned to non-defaulted status and the prolonged time in default respectively, ensures the inclusion of the potential impact of a considered downturn period which may not be measurable at the level of the average realised LGD or annual recoveries. Indeed, if, for example, an impact is measurable only with respect to a material increase of observed time in default, this analysis will ensure the incorporation of the downturn impact into the LGD estimation, for example by applying the increased time in default to the observations. The same principle applies to facilities returned to non-defaulted status.|162

Paragraph 27(b) of the GL accounts for situations in which one or several of the outlined analyses cannot be meaningfully conducted due to insufficient coverage of loss data during one year of a multi-year downturn period. This should not be confused with a situation in which no data are available for the considered downturn period because of this period being too far back in time. However, in order to account for the issue of scarce data, the policy allows the merging of consecutive years of observations as long as it is deemed of benefit for the analysis.|130

Background and rationale > 2.6 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact|50. Finally, the last paragraph on the impact assessment requires that any lag between a downturn period and its potential impact on the relevant loss data has to be taken into account. Due to the individual situations regarding data availability as well as the specifics of a considered type of exposure, no guidance is set out regarding the length of the time lags that should be considered.|94
1647|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 51|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.6 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact|51. The guidance regarding the calibration of downturn LGD for cases in which loss data are available to assess the impact of a considered downturn period on a considered calibration segment is laid down in section 5 of the final GL. Paragraph 28 clarifies that the resulting LGD estimation needs to be coherent with the outcome obtained from the impact analysis. In other words, the final downturn LGDs should appropriately account for the material impacts of a considered downturn period on (i) the realised LGDs; (ii) the annual recoveries; (ii) the facilities returned to non-defaulted status; and (iv) time in default. The policy leaves flexibility to institutions with respect to the detailed methodology applied for the purpose of calibration of downturn LGD based on results of the impact assessment. The rationale for this is that the EBA considers that there is no one-size-fits-all aggregation scheme for the results obtained from the analyses required in paragraph 27. Depending on the risk profile of the considered type of exposure it might be appropriate to choose the average LGD by vintage of defaults affected by the considered downturn period where this best reflects the results obtained from the impact assessment laid down in paragraph 27(a), points (i) to (iv). In another case, in particular where the average LGD would incorporate significant catch-up effects due to late recoveries when economic conditions improved (as outlined in paragraph 45 above), it might be more appropriate to base the downturn LGD estimation on the impact observed on annual recoveries per source of cash flow. The flexibility to select an appropriate methodology to calibrate downturn LGD includes the ability to use the 'haircut approach', outlined in section 6 in the GL, as a methodology under section 5 of the GL.|375
1648|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 52|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.6 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact|52. In order to reflect the material aspects addressed in the impact assessment in paragraph 27(a), points (i) to (iv), institutions should aim to continue reflecting the credit risk profile of the considered type of exposure. For example, setting a downturn haircut (based on observed loss data) on only the best-quality collateral based on materiality, in order to reflect the results obtained from the impact assessment, may not be a compliant approach, as it could lead to incentives to use less good-quality collateral.|123
1649|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 53|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.6 Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact|53. The impact analysis is particularly important to ensure that the long-run average LGD may be deemed appropriate as a downturn LGD estimate only when no impact of a considered downturn period can be observed on the relevant loss data and realised LGDs. The detailed conditions under which the long-run average LGD including the corresponding MoC may be appropriate for the final downturn LGD appropriate for an economic downturn are laid down in paragraph 29. It should be noted that only if observed data are available for a considered downturn period may the long-run average LGD (under certain conditions) be considered an appropriate downturn LGD estimate. In particular, it is required that the MoC under consideration cover for all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods, including deficiencies identified under Category A in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, and under Category B in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation.|217
1650|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 54|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > General description|54. If no sufficient data are available to calibrate downturn LGD in accordance with the proposed policy described above, institutions should aim to calibrate their downturn LGDs based on the estimated impact of the downturn period under consideration. However, institutions should estimate that impact by applying either a haircut or an extrapolation approach. Where institutions have observed data for only a certain intermediate parameter or risk driver reflecting the impact of the downturn period under consideration, institutions should estimate the realised historical LGDs (which they have not observed) affected by the downturn period under consideration by combining the observed impact on the intermediate parameter or risk driver with the estimated impact of other intermediate parameters resulting from a haircut and/or extrapolation approach. As stated above, both approaches can be used to estimate unobserved realised LGDs or intermediate parameters or risk drivers from the past.|190
1651|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 55|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > General description|55. The haircut approach provides an estimate indirectly by adjusting (i.e. applying a haircut to) the input variables of the LGD model. Thus, a haircut approach relies on the functional relationship that is established in the model between realised losses and certain input parameters. In particular, in order to apply a haircut approach, this functional relationship needs to describe the dependency of the LGD estimate on several risk drivers, of which at least one is an economic factor. This might especially be the case when collateral values are used as risk drivers . The downturn LGD estimate is then computed by applying the LGD model where the above-mentioned economic factor (or even factors) is/are adjusted to reflect the level observed in the downturn period under consideration. The haircut approach may equally be applied to intermediate risk parameters or risk drivers.|188
1652|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 56|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > General description|56. The extrapolation approach is a methodology to enable the institution to estimate downturn LGDs based on estimated historical loss data (based on backward extrapolation). This approach estimates 'realised' historical LGDs, intermediate parameters or even risk drivers that serve as an input into the LGD estimation model under consideration, by extrapolating them backwards in time based on the statistical dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors. It is worth noting that this dependency needs to be established using the observed loss data.|132
1653|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 57|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > General description|57. The main difference from the haircut approach is that the extrapolation approach derives the calibration target for downturn LGD based on the RDS and a statistical model for the dependency between realised LGDs (aggregated at different points in time) and economic factors, whereas the haircut approach derives the calibration target for downturn LGD by applying an existing LGD estimation model to the current exposures using input variables adjusted to reflect downturn conditions.|109

Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > General description|58. Finally, it is worth noting that, when the haircut or extrapolation approach is applied, a strictly positive Category A MoC needs to be applied to reflect the related uncertainty with respect to the estimated impact. This is laid down in paragraph 35 of the GL.|79
1655|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 59|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Haircut approach|59. Paragraph 31 of these GL describes the haircut approach and sets out the conditions under which institutions should apply this approach. Under this approach, the impact of a considered downturn period on the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers of a considered type of exposure is estimated by applying the LGD model using adjusted input parameters. Therefore, a precondition for the applicability of this approach is that the LGD model takes one or several economic factors as direct or transformed input. Then, when the LGD model is applied, these economic factors are adjusted to reflect the values of the economic factors observed in economic downturn conditions instead of applying the current values of these economic factors).|159
1656|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 60|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Haircut approach|60. Figure_Functions1|31

Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Haircut approach|"61. The policy in paragraph 30 requires the use of a haircut approach if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
i. There are not sufficient data to calibrate downturn LGDs based on observed impact on loss data (i.e. the policy laid down in paragraph 24 applies).
ii. An economic factor that has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of the RTS on economic downturn relates to a relevant type of collateral for the type of exposure under consideration and is a direct or transformed input of the institution's model for LGD estimation."|140
1671|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 62|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Haircut approach|62. Two remarks are important to make. First, it should be noted that the mandatory use of the haircut approach is related to the situation where the LGD estimation model takes as one of its inputs the economic factor related to a relevant collateral type for the type of exposure under consideration (e.g. market values or a market index). In this case, the policy prescribes that the actual haircut (i.e. the adjustment of the economic factor which serves as input into the model to reflect downturn conditions) should be based on the most severe observed value of the market price, or market price index, in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn in accordance with Article 3 of the RTS on economic downturn. Second, institutions may also apply a haircut approach where applicable, i.e. where an economic factor is a direct or transformed input to the LGD model and is not related to the relevant collateral types to calibrate downturn LGD estimates. If for example the GDP is a direct or transformed input into the LGD model, a haircut approach may be used as well, but it is not mandatory.|249
1672|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 63|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Haircut approach|63. Finally, it should be mentioned that institutions that have to quantify LGD based on the observed impact of an economic downturn on loss data, as set out in paragraph 23 of the GL, are not prohibited from using haircut approaches for the purpose of calibrating their LGD model to the quantification of downturn LGD estimations achieved in accordance with paragraph 23 of the GL. An institution that has observed loss data affected by an economic downturn for a type of exposure under consideration needs to calculate haircuts such that the resulting downturn LGD estimates reflect the observed impact from an economic downturn (i.e. to reach the calibration target) in accordance with paragraph 28 of the GL, whereas an institution that does not have such data needs to consider haircuts in accordance with the downturn severities observed in respect of the corresponding economic factors in accordance with paragraph 31 of the GL, and add an additional MoC.|210
1673|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 64|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Extrapolation approach|64. Paragraph 32 of the final GL describes the extrapolation approach and sets out requirements for the application of this approach. For the purpose of these GL, 'the extrapolation approach' refers to a methodology to estimate realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or even risk drivers that serve as an input into the LGD estimation model under consideration. These estimated realised LGDs (or intermediate parameters or risk drivers) are extrapolated backwards in time based on the dependency of the realised LGDs (or intermediate parameters or risk drivers) on relevant economic factors. This dependency should be established based on observed loss data. The graph in Example 6 illustrates the concept of the extrapolation approach, where the red vertical line illustrates the time from which onwards the institution has reliable data, and the red horizontal line illustrates the resulting downturn LGD estimation.|191

Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Extrapolation approach|65. The extrapolation approach has, however, been perceived as potentially leading to less conservative results and might also suffer from uncertainty about whether or not the derived dependency will also apply under non-observed downturn conditions. Therefore, a requirement is added in paragraph 35 to cover the additional uncertainty related to the use of the extrapolation approach with an additional MoC.|99
1678|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 66|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Extrapolation approach|66. It may be the case that only for a major share of economic loss the impact of a considered downturn period can be estimated by a haircut or extrapolation approach. There may, however, be other, less significant (but not immaterial), components of economic loss where the impact of the downturn period under consideration can be estimated by neither a haircut nor an extrapolation approach. In order not to push these cases under the scope of application of section 7, the EBA considers it appropriate to allow an estimation of the impact on these less significant components based on observed data from a different period than from the downturn period under consideration, yet still with the objective of estimating the impact of the downturn period under consideration. This is included in paragraph 32(b)(ii) of the draft GL.|185
1679|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 67|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Extrapolation approach|"67. The approach described in paragraph 32(b)(ii) of the GL should be limited to specific cases. Therefore, the policy sets out several restrictions on the use of this approach, clarifying that the approach may be followed only:
i. for intermediate parameters and risk drivers (e.g. cure rates or recovery rates) and
ii. where the major shares of economic loss are covered already by a haircut or extrapolation approach and
iii. where no statistically significant dependency can be established on the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration and
iv. where the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low volatility over the time period for which it has been observed."|161
1680|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 68|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.7 Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact > Extrapolation approach|68. However, where this version of the extrapolation approach is used, institutions should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the relation between the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the downturn period under consideration identified in accordance with Article 3 of the RTS and the value of these economic factors observed under other adverse economic conditions as referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii).|105
1683|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 69|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.8 Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available|69. Section 7 (paragraph 36) of these GL allows for exceptional cases: where neither the approach outlined in section 5 nor the approach laid down in section 6 can be applied, and where institutions can justify to the satisfaction of the competent authority that none of the approaches is applicable, the institution may apply any alternative methodology to calibrate downturn LGD estimates. Where this approach needs to be applied, the institution can rely only on observed loss data during favourable economic conditions for the type of exposure under consideration (as otherwise the approach set out in section 5 would be applicable). As the institution applies a calibration methodology which might be more favourable than those outlined in section 6, it needs to quantify an MoC in relation to this downturn LGD estimation such that the final downturn LGD estimate including MoC is higher than or equal to the long- run average LGD plus 15 percentage points. In any case, the final downturn LGD estimate should be lower than or equal to 105%.|228
1684|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 70|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.9 Reference value|70. Finally, it should be noted that section 8 (paragraph 37) describes the calculation of a reference value that acts as a non-binding challenger to downturn LGD estimation at calibration level, irrespective of the methodology used.|59
1685|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 71|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.10 Remarks|71. It should be clear from the policy as well as from the rationale outlined above that there is a hierarchy of the approaches to quantification of downturn LGD estimates. This hierarchy is outlined in paragraphs 23 to 25 of the GL. Where loss data affected by a downturn period are available, the institution needs to follow the policy set out in section 5 of the final GL. Otherwise, the institution needs to follow the policy set out in section 6 and only in very exceptional cases should downturn LGD estimates be calibrated in accordance with section 7. This approach should make downturn LGD estimation more transparent and comparable than in the past. At the same time, it is aimed at providing sufficient flexibility for the institutions. The policy will make it easier to distinguish risk-based variability in applied LGD parameters from variability stemming from other sources.|181
1686|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 72|Downturn LGD estimation|2. Background and rationale > 2.10 Remarks|72. The policy also accounts for situations in which the observed impact of an economic downturn on the relevant loss data is zero or near zero. In addition, it clarifies the terminology by distinguishing between the identified economic downturn for a type of exposure under consideration and its impact, i.e. by noting that, if the relevant loss data show no impact of an economic downturn, it does not necessarily mean that there is no economic downturn or that there will be no impact in the future. Although there might be cases in which the identified economic factors do not show a cyclical pattern, the RTS on economic downturn provide a clear definition that works independently of such patterns (which could also just reflect very long cycles). Moreover, it should be noted that the notion of the duration provided in Article 3 of the RTS on economic downturn is particularly relevant to applying the policy laid down in paragraph 27 of the final GL and the notion of severity is particularly relevant to applying the policy laid down in paragraph 31 of the GL.|214
1687|Final Report Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (‘Downturn LGD estimation’)|Paragraph 73|Downturn LGD estimation|2.

(a) calibrate downturn LGD at least at the same level at which institutions calculate the corresponding long-run average LGD for the purpose of calibrating LGD in accordance with paragraph 161 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation].
(b) split the set of facilities covered by the same LGD model into as many different calibration segments as needed where each calibration segment carries a significantly different loss profile and might thus be affected differently by different downturn periods; for this purpose, institutions should at least consider the appropriateness of introducing calibration segments that cover material shares of exposure in different geographical areas, in different industry sectors and, for retail exposures, of different product types;"|184

Where institutions identify multiple downturn periods in accordance with the final draft RTS on economic downturn submitted by EBA [RTS on economic downturn],
(a) they should perform each of the steps in the following sequence:
(i) calibrate downturn LGD for each identified downturn period in accordance with Section 4.3 for each calibration segment;
(ii) for each of those downturn periods, apply the resulting downturn LGD estimates to their current non-defaulted exposures of the type of exposures under consideration and at the time of calibration;
(iii) choose the period as finally relevant downturn period that results in the highest average downturn LGD, including final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], on a considered calibration segment of their current non-defaulted exposures as referred to in (ii). Institutions should then use the resulting downturn LGDs based on the finally relevant downturn period for each calibration segment to comply with paragraph 181 (b) CRR.
(iv) in case that institutions can calibrate downturn LGD in accordance with Section 5 or Section 6 for at least one downturn period but they are unable to quantify downturn LGD in accordance with Section 5 or Section 6 for one or several other downturn periods, consider only the estimates based on Section 5 or Section 6, and add appropriate Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the final downturn LGD estimates to cover for the downturn periods where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess or estimate the impact is not available;

(a) where institutions use separate estimation methodologies for long-run average LGD and downturn LGD, compare their final downturn LGDs used for calibration plus the according final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], to their long-run average LGDs plus the according final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] at the level where the long-run average LGD is calculated for the purpose of calibrating LGD in accordance with paragraph 161 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation];
(b) where institutions set a single LGD estimate, which involves a long-run average LGD estimation and a downturn adjustment added to the long-run average LGD estimation, they should ensure that the final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] on the downturn LGD estimates encompasses the uncertainties stemming from both the long-run average LGD estimation and the calculation of the downturn adjustment."|298

(a) analyse the difference between the distribution of exposures over facility grades or pools, or over appropriate intervals in case of continuous facility scales, of the current portfolio and the likely distribution of the current portfolio impacted by the relevant downturn period selected in accordance with paragraph 15,
(b) if there is a substantial difference as a result of the analysis in (a), institutions should apply an adjustment to their downturn LGD estimates to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn in accordance with Article 181(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."|185

In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered downturn period, institutions should carry out an analysis of the impact of this downturn period on the loss data related to the considered calibration segment.
(a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following:
(i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn period taking into account all of the following:
(1) the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] or have been closed before;
(2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each year after default should be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1) for each year in which the defaults occurred.
(ii) evidence of decreased annual recoveries by sources of recoveries that are relevant for the considered calibration segment. These annual recoveries should be analysed with and without repossessions where applicable and irrespective of the date of default;
(iii) evidence of decreased numbers of exposures that defaulted and returned back to the non-defaulted status within a predefined fixed horizons for all defaults that happened in a considered year in accordance with Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; The predefined fixed horizon should be appropriate for the type of exposure under consideration.
(iv) evidence of increased time in default per year related to all defaults in a considered year.
(b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis.
(c) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) and (b), shall take into account any lag between a downturn period and the time when its potential impact is observed on the relevant loss data."|470

(a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods;
(b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A, MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are applicable."|229

Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the methodologies specified in paragraph 31 ('haircut approach') and paragraph 32 ('extrapolation approach') or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on:
(a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers;
(b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of economic loss in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26;
In particular the haircut approach should be considered most appropriate for the above purposes where the market value or an according index related to a relevant type of collateral serves as a direct or transformed input into an institution's model for LGD estimation and has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn]."|263

(a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period;
(b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met:
(i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a);
(ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions.

Background and rationale > Next steps|1. Articles 181(1)(b) and 182(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) specify that institutions shall use LGD and CF estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the respective long-run averages. In this regard, Articles 181(3)(a) and 182(4)(a) of the CRR mandate the EBA to specify the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn, appropriate for LGD DT and CF DT estimated by institutions. According to the CRR mandates, these draft RTS specify the three characteristics of the economic downturn - its nature, severity and duration - but do not cover the estimation methodology used by institutions to reflect these downturn conditions in LGD DT and CF DT estimates. Guidance on the estimation methodology to be used for LGD DT parameters will be provided in the GL for downturn LGD estimation. Ultimately, these RTS and the GL, which will be integrated into the GL on PD, LGD estimation and treatment of defaulted assets (EBA/GL/2017/16) published on 20 November 2017 (EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation), will provide a comprehensive approach to the identification and incorporation of the downturn component into an IRB model.|274

Background and rationale > Next steps|2. The requirement for LGD and CF estimates to reflect economic downturn conditions was introduced in the Basel II framework and stems from the general economic model that is applied to derive the formula used in that framework to calculate own funds requirements. In the Basel II framework, the own funds requirements for unexpected losses relies on the conditional expected loss, which again is based on a conservative value of a single systematic risk factor. This factor, representing the global business conditions, entails that the conditional expected loss corresponds to the level of expected losses in an economic downturn. The conditional expected loss is defined as the conditional PD multiplied by the conditional LGD and the conditional exposure at default (EAD). At the same time, although the regulatory formula includes a supervisory mapping function to derive conditional PDs from average PDs estimated by the institutions, it does not provide an explicit function that would transform average LGDs and EADs into conditional LGDs and EADs. Instead, it is specified only that 'banks are asked to report LGDs that reflect economic downturn conditions in circumstances where loss severities are expected to be higher during cyclical downturns than during typical business conditions'.|240

Background and rationale > Next steps|3.

Background and rationale > Next steps|"4. Figure 1 visualises the economic downturn as a multi-dimensional object defined by its nature, severity and duration. The draft RTS specify an economic downturn with respect to the business cycle relevant for the type of exposures under consideration; therefore:
* The nature of an economic downturn is specified through the economic factors that are explanatory variables or indicators of the business cycle for the type of exposures under consideration. Therefore, the nature of the economic downturn is defined as a set of relevant economic factors identified in accordance with Article 2.
* The severity of an economic downturn is specified as the most severe values observed on the relevant economic factors over a given historical period. In other words, the severity of an economic downturn is specified as a set containing one distinct severity for each relevant economic factor.
* Finally, the duration of an economic downturn is specified via the concept of the ‘downturn period’. In this respect, the notion of downturn period is introduced in Article 1 as a period of time in which the peaks or troughs, which relate to the most severe values in accordance with Article 3, of one or several economic factors are observed.

According to the above concepts, a downturn period could include either one or several economic factors identified based on their associated severities. Put differently, a downturn period is characterised by a set of economic factors the most severe values are reached simultaneously or are the effect of one overall economic condition."|294

Background and rationale > Next steps|"5. It should be noted that, according to this, the duration of an economic downturn is specified by the duration of the identified downturn periods, where the duration of a downturn period refers generally to the 12-month period in which the downturn conditions are observed on the economic factor related to this downturn period. However, some flexibility is provided with respect to the duration of a downturn period, e.g. where the most severe realisation of an underlying economic factor is observed over a longer period of time. It should be stressed that the duration of an economic downturn (specified by the set of durations of the downturn periods covered) is therefore independent of the institution's loss experience and should not be confused with the period in which the impact of a downturn period can be observed on an institution's loss data.

Background and rationale > Article 1: General|7. Article 1 sets out the structure of the RTS by pointing to the relevant articles in which the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn are specified. In particular, paragraph 2 introduces the concept of a downturn period as a period of time in which the peaks/troughs of one or several relevant economic factors are reached simultaneously, or respectively when they are not reached simultaneously, but are nonetheless the effect of one single economic condition. Moreover, Article 1 specifies in paragraphs 3 the level at which an economic downturn should be specified. The proposed policy requires that an economic downturn is identified for each type of exposure, as defined in Article 142(2) of the CRR. Such an approach ensures alignment with the scope of application of a rating system.|167

Background and rationale > Article 1: General|8. The concept of a downturn period is relevant for identifying the duration of an economic downturn. The latter in fact comprises a set of durations, one for each downturn period. Moreover, as explained above, the concept of several downturn periods constituting one economic downturn to be considered for the purpose of estimating LGDs and CFs appropriate for an economic downturn reflects that different economic factors may reach their peaks/troughs in different periods of time and these periods of time may reveal different impacts on an institution's loss and credit line use data depending on their underwriting, collateralisation and workout processes (respective to their limit policies for CF).|139

Background and rationale > Article 1: General|"9. In this respect, the design of the economic downturn to be considered for the purpose of LGD DT and CF DT estimates may consist of either:
* one downturn period, if the peaks or troughs related to the severities of the relevant economic factors are reached simultaneously or are related to the same overall economic condition;
* several downturn periods, if the peaks/troughs of the relevant economic factors are observed in different time periods and are not related to the same overall economic condition.

In the latter case (i.e. in which there is more than one downturn period), the GL on downturn LGD estimation clarify how to treat multiple downturn periods in the context of LGD downturn estimation."|151

In doing so, institutions should ensure that an economic factor is included in the set constituting the nature of an economic downturn once for each jurisdiction and, where relevant, the sector, which is covered by a material share of the type of exposures under consideration. Moreover, the economic factors referred to in Article 2(1) shall be considered in levels or changes in levels, as most appropriate.|185

Background and rationale > Article 2: Nature of an economic downturn|"11. This means that GDP and unemployment rates for the jurisdiction(s), which cover material shares of the portfolio under consideration, are relevant for the specification of an economic downturn. In this context it is worth noting that the draft GL on downturn LGD estimation will account for the situation in which the set of economic factors relevant for the whole type of exposure may contain factors that will only have an impact on an institution's loss data for a considered subset (say, one of several jurisdictions) but not on other subsets. As an example, assume that a portfolio covers two jurisdictions: country C4 and country C6 (with equal shares of exposure). When specifying the nature of an economic downturn for this portfolio, the institution needs to include GDP and unemployment rates for both C4 and C6. For example, consider the time series for the unemployment rates of C4 and C6 in the following illustration:
See ""Unemployment rate in 2 jurisdictions covered by one type of exposure"""|211

Background and rationale > Article 2: Nature of an economic downturn|12. In this example, the institution would need to consider two downturn periods: one in 1996 driven by the peak in unemployment rate in country C6 and one in 2014 driven by the peak in unemployment rate in country C4. The rationale for this customisation of economic factors to the relevant geographical areas and sectors is that it ensures that the most appropriate economic factors are considered and that it harmonises the notion of an economic downturn regardless of the institution's modelling or risk management choices. Another example of reflecting the distribution across sectors of the type of exposures under consideration would be a case in which the main sectors covered by a considered rating system for corporate exposures were agriculture and tourism. In this example, the industry indices for agriculture and tourism would be the relevant economic factors according to Article 2(1)(b)(i).|183

Background and rationale > Article 2: Nature of an economic downturn|13. It is important to note that the RTS may indeed require the use of a set of factors for one of the economic factors listed in Article 2(1), each one reflecting a subset of the type of exposures under consideration. For example, an institution may need to consider a set of GDP series to reflect the geographical distribution of the exposure covered by the rating system under consideration. Moreover, no weighting should be applied to aggregate different relevant economic factors reflecting subsets of exposures stemming from, for example, different jurisdictions. Instead, these should just be considered to be part of the set of economic factors specifying the nature of an economic downturn of the type of exposure under consideration.|150

Background and rationale > Article 2: Nature of an economic downturn|14. The list in Article 2(1) specifies the economic factors that are relevant for the purpose of identifying the nature of the economic downturn of a type of exposure (i.e. portfolios) under consideration. It should be noted that the externally provided aggregate default rates and credit losses may refer to a different definition of default from the one specified in Article 178 of the CRR, which is fine, as these factors are considered for the purpose of revealing cyclical behaviour and not for the purpose of estimating long-run average loss rates as defined in Article 181 of the CRR. Moreover, it should be emphasised that these economic factors are relevant only if publicly available or if the costs of acquiring such data are not disproportionate with respect to the materiality of the type of exposures under consideration. In particular, aggregate credit losses may not be available for all jurisdictions.|190

Background and rationale > Article 2: Nature of an economic downturn|15. As the list in Article 2(1) may not contain all economic factors relevant for the economic cycle related to the type of exposures considered, Article 2(3) requires institutions to consider additional economic factors, beyond those contained in the mandatory list in Article 2(1), that are explanatory variables for or indicators of the business cycle of the type of exposures considered. As a general example, interest rates or stock indices could be considered as additional relevant economic factors.|112

Background and rationale > Article 3: Severity of an economic downturn|16. For the purpose of specifying the severity of an economic downturn, institutions are requested to select the most severe value for each of the relevant economic factors based on historical values observed over the last 20 years. Therefore, the severity of an economic downturn can be understood as a set of severities containing one severity for each relevant economic factor identified in accordance with Article 2. To avoid an overly mechanistic approach, the RTS also specify conditions under which the severity identified, over the last 20 years, would not be considered sufficiently severe. In these cases, institutions are required to use longer time series of the various economic factors. This approach avoids the situation where, for example, a resulting downturn LGD estimation would significantly change as a result of a recalibration conducted at a point in time at which a previously detected downturn would drop out of the 20-year period sliding time window. Moreover, it covers the situation in which no significant variation in values can be observed within the last 20 years, as may be the case in individual jurisdictions that have not experienced any significant downturn conditions in the preceding 20 years for a particular economic factor. For the purpose of harmonisation, observations of relevant economic factors relate to a 12- month period in these draft RTS.|269

Background and rationale > Article 3: Severity of an economic downturn|17. Regarding the length of the time series, looking at only 10 years of data history, i.e. approximately one economic cycle, might not be sufficient to capture the severity of an economic downturn. For the sake of simplicity and comparability a uniform backward-looking period of 20 years is therefore considered in the RTS.|81

Background and rationale > Article 3: Severity of an economic downturn|18. In summary, severity corresponds to the worst 12-month average value for the economic factor realisations under consideration. Paragraph 2 of Article 3 clarifies that, when identifying the worst 12-month average value of the economic factor, the 12-month period can start at any point in time within the identification period, if the historical data for the considered economic factor is available more frequently than annually.|98

Background and rationale > Article 4: Duration of an economic downturn|19. Article 4 of the draft RTS refers to the duration of an economic downturn. As such, the duration of an economic downturn is a set of durations, one for each identified downturn period.|56

Background and rationale > Article 4: Duration of an economic downturn|"20. If the downturn period relates to only one economic factor, the duration will be the 12-month period in which the most severe value of the considered economic factor is observed. However, where this severity is observed over a period longer than 12 months (i.e. the economic factor does not significantly move or fluctuate from its most severe 12-month observation), the duration of this downturn period, relating only to one economic factor, may last longer. Figure 2 below displays an example in which the duration of a downturn period with unemployment rate as the unique economic factor is longer than 12 months due to prolonged severe conditions affecting the unemployment rate. As Figure 2 shows, the unemployment rate peaks, i.e. the severity of the unemployment rate is observed, during both 2002 and 2003. In this case, the duration of the downturn period should be 2 years.
See ""Figure 2: Duration longer than 12 months due to prolonged severity observed for one economic factor - Article 4(2)(a)"""|226

Background and rationale > Article 4: Duration of an economic downturn|"21.A longer duration could be also considered for a downturn period relating to one economic factor, according to Article 4(2)(c), where the peak and trough related to the severity of that economic factor show adjacent peaks and troughs related to the same economic conditions. Figure 3 below plots again a hypothetical time series for unemployment rate. The severity of the unemployment rate is defined according to the worst observed value (referring to a 12-month period), which, according to the figure below, is 2003. Unemployment rate shows an adjacent peak in 2005, which could be related to the peak in 2003 (if it is the result of the same economic conditions), leading to a duration of the downturn period of 3 years (2003-2005).

Background and rationale > Article 4: Duration of an economic downturn|"22. A downturn period comprises different economic factors and, therefore, the peaks or troughs related to the severity of each relevant economic factor, as specified in Article 3, may not be reached simultaneously. However, if this is the effect of one overall economic condition, the duration of the downturn period related to these economic factors should be long enough to reflect the extended downturn situation. As an example, consider the time series for GDP growth and productivity index displayed in Figure 4 below. In accordance with Article 4(2)(b), the set of economic factors pointing to the same overall economic condition should be assigned to the same downturn duration, even if the respective severities are not reached simultaneously. In this example, an institution should analyse whether or not the trough in 2010 for GDP growth and the trough in 2009 for the productivity index relate to the same overall economic condition and, if so, reflect this by identifying the downturn period as starting in 2009 and lasting until 2010.

Background and rationale > Article 4: Duration of an economic downturn|"23. It should be noted that there could be cases in which both points (b) and (c) of Article 4(2) apply. Figure 5 below shows an example where GDP growth and production index have correlated severities, as in Figure 4 above. Moreover, the production index shows a trough in 2007 adjacent to the trough defining its severity in 2009, which is the result of the same overall economic condition. In this case, institutions shall consider the downturn period comprising both economic factors to last from 2007 to 2010 (where we observe the troughs for GDP growth defining its severity).

Background and rationale > Article 4: Duration of an economic downturn|24. Generally, no durations shorter than 12 months should be considered for the purpose of a more stable and harmonised notion of downturn (as economic factors that are available on only a yearly basis need to be comparable to economic factors available at a higher frequency). The option to deviate from 12-month durations for downturn periods, as laid down in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 4(2), should not lead to unreasonably long downturn periods, which would probably rather reflect structural changes than adverse conditions in cyclical behaviours of the economic factors considered. There should be no concern that longer downturn periods could lead to the inclusion of numerous non-downturn observations in the LGD downturn estimate and thus lower it, as, under the proposed approach in the GL on downturn LGD estimation the duration of an economic downturn defines only the period in relation to which the impact of a downturn period has to be analysed.|206

Background and rationale > Identification of an economic downturn: examples|"25. To better clarify the general concept, the economic downturn is illustrated in a couple of examples. To determine the economic downturn for an individual portfolio in accordance with the specification in these draft RTS, an institution would first need to select the relevant economic factors. As an example, consider a portfolio of corporate exposures mainly covering production- related businesses located in jurisdiction A. According to Article 2, an institution would consider at least the GDP and the unemployment rate of jurisdiction A as relevant economic factors, as well as the productivity index for the production industry (assuming that externally provided default rates and credit losses are not available), for the purpose of specifying the nature of an economic downturn. In this example, the economic factors are considered in terms of changes, i.e. the GDP growth, the changes in unemployment rate and the changes in the productivity index considered.
See ""Figure 6: Economic factors for a portfolio of corporate exposures mainly covering production-related businesses"""|203
1760|Final Draft Regulatory Technical Standards on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn in accordance with Articles 181(3)(a) and 182(4)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 26|Specification of economic downturn|2. Background and rationale > Identification of an economic downturn: examples|26. In a second step, the institution would need to select the most severe observed value (relating to a 12 month period) in at least 20 years for each economic factor, which occurs in 2009 for the productivity index and the GDP and in 2003 for the unemployment rate. Therefore, the final economic downturn to be considered for the purpose of LGD estimation would consist of two downturn periods: the first one, in 2009 is characterised by the productivity index and the GDP - each carrying as severity its levels of 2009 and the second one in 2003, where the highest level in the unemployment rate has been observed. The rationale for specifying that an economic downturn as potentially comprising two or more downturn periods is that a portfolio can be affected to a different extent by different economic factors. Even for two portfolios relating to the same type of exposuress (e.g. retail real estate financing), the impact of a downturn period on an institution's loss data may be different depending among other things on the contract design, collateralisation and the institution's work-out procedures.|237
1761|Final Draft Regulatory Technical Standards on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn in accordance with Articles 181(3)(a) and 182(4)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013|Paragraph 27|Specification of economic downturn|2. Background and rationale > Identification of an economic downturn: examples|"27. This difference is best illustrated by considering an example of retail mortgage portfolios of two different banks: bank A and bank B. Bank A has a very high rate of credits that revert to non- defaulted status because of low LTVs and high penalty fees or interest rates for exposures in default. At the same time, bank B has a low rate of credits that revert to non-defaulted status because of early contract termination and collection procedures. In this example, it is reasonable to assume that bank A may observe an impact from a high unemployment rate on its rate of return to non- defaulted status, as those obligors that defaulted because of unemployment may remain in default longer than those that defaulted under average economic conditions. For bank B, such an impact is less probable because of the early termination policy. To further explore this example, in accordance with these draft RTS, the banks would identify two downturn periods for the types of exposure considered, namely 2003 (where the unemployment rate peaks) and 2012 (where GDP and house price indices show troughs):

Background and rationale > Identification of an economic downturn: examples|28. As illustrated in the example above, it is likely that the economic downturn to be considered in LGD downturn estimation will comprise more than one downturn period. Furthermore, for comparable portfolios relating to the same underlying business, an impact from one downturn period may be visible for one bank or even sub-portfolio but not for another bank or sub-portfolio. The proposed draft RTS harmonise the economic factors that institutions need to consider for a given type of exposures as well as the duration and severity related to these economic factors. Therefore, the RTS will ensure that the same economic downturn is identified, while the GL on LGD downturn estimation will ensure that different impacts of the same economic downturn are recognised.|153

Background and rationale > Identification of an economic downturn: examples|"29. The analysis of how the downturn periods of the economic downturn identified impact the loss data of an individual portfolio will, as previously noted, be treated separately in the GL for downturn LGD estimation. However, it is useful to understand the interaction with the envisaged process of downturn LGD estimation and to show which part of this process is covered by these draft RTS and which part is covered by the GL on LGD downturn estimation. The following illustration provides this overview:
See ""Step 1: Identification of relevant economic factors and their severities"", ""Step 2: Identification of downturn periods and their duration"", ""Step 3: Analysis of the impact of all identified downturn periods on an institution’s relevant loss data"", “Step 4: Estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn”"|175

Background and rationale > Identification of an economic downturn: examples|30. The rationale for disentangling the specification of an economic downturn from the requirements on LGD DT or CF DT estimation is that in this way the RTS provide a common specification of the nature, duration and severity of an economic downturn for portfolios relating to comparable types of exposure. The impact of the harmonised identification of the economic downturn on an institution's relevant loss data may, however, be very specific. It may in particular depend on the following non-exhaustive elements: (1) the institution-specific contract design; (2) collateralisation policies and work-out procedures; and (3) the general measures taken by an institution to limit the impact of an economic downturn on its business. Whereas these differences do not influence the identification of an economic downturn, they are expected to influence the realised LGD or relevant drivers of the realised LGD and, in turn, the factors institutions are expected to account for when assessing the appropriateness of their LGD estimates with respect to the economic downturn identified.|215

Background and rationale > Identification of an economic downturn: examples|31. This approach deviates from the proposed draft RTS presented in the Consultation Paper (CP/EBA/2017/02), which tackled to some extent both the specification of an economic downturn and some aspects of LGD estimation methodologies appropriate for an economic downturn. The approach presented in the draft RTS of the CP reflected an economic factors approach in which the downturn is driven by macroeconomic and credit-related factors (economic factors). The approach required specific analysis to identify the economic factors appropriate for the considered portfolio and LGD estimation method (e.g. analysis of the dependency of economic factors with specific features of realised LGDs and CFs, i.e. 'model components'). The proposed approach in the CP aimed to retain risk sensitivity while ruling out variability stemming from different approaches to identifying the relevant economic downturn conditions, but at the cost of high complexity. The approach presented in these draft RTS avoids this complexity and provides a clear and common specification of an economic downturn in terms of its nature, duration and severity.|214

(b) a period shorter than the one referred to in point (a), where the considered relevant economic factor has changed significantly due to the accession of the concerned country to the European Union; or
(c) a period longer than the one referred to in point (a), where the values observed for a considered economic factor in the minimum period referred to in point (a) are not sufficiently severe."|209

1782|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 1|Other|Foreword|1. Articles 143, 283 and 363 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) 1 require the European Central Bank (ECB) to grant permission to use internal models for credit risk, counterparty credit risk and market risk where the requirements set out in the corresponding chapters of the CRR are met by the institution(s) concerned. Based on the current applicable European Union (EU) and national law, the ECB guide to internal models provides transparency on how the ECB understands those rules and how it intends to apply them when assessing whether institutions meet these requirements.|124
1783|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 2|Other|Foreword|2. The guide is also intended as a document for the internal use of the different supervisory teams, with the aim of ensuring a common and consistent approach to matters related to internal models. When applying the relevant regulatory framework in specific cases, the ECB will take into due consideration the particular circumstances of the institution concerned.|66
1784|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 3|Other|Foreword|3. This guide should not be construed as going beyond the current existing applicable EU law including, among others, adopted regulatory technical standards (RTS), and national law and therefore is not intended to replace or overrule applicable EU and national law.|52
1785|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 3|Other|Foreword|In accordance with the requirements set out in the CRR, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has drafted RTS. These include the Final draft RTS on the specification of the assessment methodology for competent authorities regarding compliance of an institution with the requirement to use internal models for market risk and assessment of significant share. 2 These specify how competent authorities should assess compliance with the regulatory framework defined in the CRR. The Final draft RTS have not yet been adopted by the European Commission, but those Final draft RTS are used in the guide as a basis for interpretative purposes. Some parts of this guide may require revision once the European Commission has adopted the RTS by means of a Delegated Regulation. The ECB will amend or delete those parts of the guide when the RTS enters into force.|158
1786|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 3|Other|Foreword|In addition, based on drafts prepared by the EBA, the European Commission has adopted Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2021/930 3 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439$^{4}$. Some parts of this guide have been revised and amended in line with the adoption of these regulations.|74
1787|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 3|Other|Foreword|The ECB provides in this guide its understanding of the CRR provisions which apply currently. This includes the amendments to the CRR introduced by Regulation (EU) 2019/876$^{5}$, except for those which relate to the alternative internal models approach (Chapter 1b). The amendments relating to the alternative internal models approach have been introduced as a specific reporting requirement for market risk as set out in Article 430b(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/876. This specific reporting requirement will only come into force in the future (on the adoption of the relevant delegated acts referred to in Article 461a of the CRR).|135
1788|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 4|Other|Foreword|"4. The concept of ""best practice"" as used in this guide can be described as actions or measures which - in the view of the ECB - ensure compliance with certain prudential requirements in a prudentially sound manner. In this context, it should be noted that (i) there can also be other actions or measures that ensure compliance, and (ii) institutions are not required to apply that practice where compliance is ensured in another way."|93
1789|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 4|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.1 Relevant regulatory references|Currently the RTS on assessment methodology for IMA and significant share only exist in the final draft version. Once adopted, these RTS will become an additional relevant regulatory reference for this guide.|55
1790|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 1|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.1 Relevant regulatory references|1. The principles listed in this section relate to internal models that are subject to supervisory approval for the calculation of own funds requirements for credit, market and counterparty credit risk (Pillar 1 models), unless stated otherwise.|67
1793|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 2|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.2 Guidelines at consolidated and subsidiary levels|2. An inconsistent implementation of internal model-related tasks within a banking group bears the risk of an inappropriate coverage of the risks measured by internal models at group level. Therefore, institutions should either develop binding group-wide (i.e. consolidated) principles and guidelines relating to the life cycle 6 of internal models$^{7}$, or ensure that each relevant entity has appropriate and independently audited principles and guidelines in place with a high degree of consistency between one another.|115
1794|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 3|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.2 Guidelines at consolidated and subsidiary levels|3. A consistent and integrated level of application of the group principles and guidelines in the relevant entities is expected. This could be ensured by applying controls that verify that these principles are implemented correctly in all relevant entities. Examples of such controls include periodic monitoring procedures by the parent entity on implementation at local level or a gap analysis between group-wide principles and local application, including local guidelines. These controls can be used to identify those gaps and to mitigate any associated risk. The group-level policies should clearly define under which circumstances deviations from the group-wide principles would be accepted. The parent entity should be informed about such deviations. The effective implementation of the policies should be periodically monitored and assessed.|157
1795|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 4|Documentation|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.3 Documentation of internal models|4. All internal models should be documented to allow a qualified third party to independently understand the methodology, assumptions, limitations and use of the model and to replicate its development and implementation.|57
1796|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 5|Documentation|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.3 Documentation of internal models|5. The institution should therefore define principles and guidelines for model documentation. These should encompass guidance for the governance of the model documentation itself. The scope of the model documentation should be defined by type of model. In-scope areas should include at least the technical aspects of the model (methodology and assumptions), data (processes), instructions for model users and performance/validation (including the results of implementation testing).|102
1797|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 6|Documentation|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.3 Documentation of internal models|6. The institution should be able to demonstrate how its documentation and the register of its internal models facilitate the internal and external understanding of the models. The institution can choose to have one or more registers for models in use, according to the different risk types (credit, market or counterparty credit risk). The register(s) should contain at least the following information for each model: 8 the model owner(s), range of application, materiality, approval date, potential restrictions on the model's use (e.g. conditions), as well as the key model weaknesses, main changes applied and change versioning. The register should also include models purchased from third-party vendors.|154
1798|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 7|Documentation|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.3 Documentation of internal models|7. Adequate controls of the register of the institution's internal models, together with an inventory of the documentation, including an annual review, should be in place. This includes a policy for document management that clearly states the roles and responsibilities involved in approving documents, as well as how changes in documentation are applied and communicated internally. In addition, the institution should have a policy regarding the adequate archiving and maintenance of information, access permissions and the assessment of the completeness and consistency of the information held.|120
1799|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 8|Documentation|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.3 Documentation of internal models|8. Documentation should be kept up to date and the institution should keep documents for an appropriate period of time, taking into account legal or regulatory retention periods.|52
1800|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 9|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.4 Implementation of a model risk management framework|"9. Effective model risk management allows institutions to reduce the risk of potential losses and underestimation of own funds requirements as a resul t of flaws in the development, implementation or use of the models. To mitigate these risks, institutions should have a model risk management framework 9 in place that allows them to identify, understand and manage their model risk for internal models across the group. This framework should comprise, at least, the following: 
(a) A written model risk management policy. This policy should, as a minimum, include a concept or a definition of what constitutes a model, provide the institution's interpretation of model risk 10 and describe the model risk framework with reference to its different components (e.g. model governance, risk control function, validation function, internal audit) and their related documented policies. 
(b) A register of the institution's internal models, as described in paragraph 6. This register should facilitate a holistic understanding of the application and use of the models and provide the institution's management body and senior management with a comprehensive overview of the models in place. 
(c) Guidelines on identifying and mitigating any areas where measurement uncertainty and model deficiencies are known to exist, according to their materiality. In particular, those elements that relate to qualitative aspects of model risk (such as data deficiencies, model misuse or implementation errors) should be considered. This methodology should be applied consistently across the group (e.g. in subsidiaries or regions). 
(d) Guidelines and methodologies for the qualitative and/or quantitative assessment and measurement 11 of the institution's model risk. 
(e) Guidelines with respect to the model life cycle as set out in paragraph 2. 
(f) Procedures for model risk communication and reporting (internal and external). 
(g) Definition of roles and responsibilities within the model risk management framework (e.g. define which unit(s) is/are in charge of or involved in independent reviews of risk estimates)."|412
1801|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 10|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.5 Identification of management body and senior management|10. Institutions should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of their management body and senior management as defined in Article 3(1) subparagraphs (7) and (9) of the CRD, as implemented in the relevant national law with regard to internal models and in relation to each risk type. The institution's internal documentation should also clearly describe the composition of the management body and the senior management.|104
1802|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 11|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.5 Identification of management body and senior management|"11. The term ""management body"" could refer to the single board, in a one-tier system, or to the function of the management and supervisory boards in a twotier corporate governance system. The institution should document the roles and responsibilities of each individual in the management body. For the purposes of this guide, the management body refers to the members of the management body in its management function (executive members)."|108
1803|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 12|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.5 Identification of management body and senior management|12. The institution should assess the appropriateness of designated committees of the management body (if applicable) in order to ensure that they provide an adequate support function for effective decision-making procedures. This holds, in particular, for decisions concerning material aspects of the institution's internal models. The institution should clearly document the composition, mandate and reporting lines of committees responsible for internal model governance and oversight, as well as the decisions taken. These committees should be given a mandate by the management body; the mandate should clearly define their tasks and authority. In order for the designated committee to be set at an appropriate level, it should be chaired by a member of the management body.|157
1804|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 13|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.5 Identification of management body and senior management|13. The institution should also be able to identify which individuals constitute its senior management with respect to the credit, market and counterparty credit risk Pillar I model frameworks. In addition to the specifications of Article 3(1) sub-paragraphs (7) and (9) of the CRD, senior management can be deemed to constitute the highest hierarchical level(s) below the management body with a clearly defined responsibility for internal models. 12 The senior management should either report directly to the management body or be responsible for providing it with the necessary information to carry out its duties, especially with regard to its oversight role. The senior management's decision-making procedures relating to all aspects of internal models should be clearly documented.|168
1805|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 14|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.6 General principles for internal validation|"14. All internal models and internal estimates should be subject to an initial, and subsequently to an annual, internal validation. For the avoidance of doubt, the term ""initial validation"" in the guide refers to the validation of new models as well as the validation of material changes and extensions to approved models."|82
1806|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 15|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.6 General principles for internal validation|"15. To ensure the effective independence of the internal validation function from the model development process (i.e. model design, development, implementation and monitoring), institutions should have appropriate organisational arrangements in place. The ECB understands that the possible organisational arrangements are as follows:$^{13}$ 
(a) separation into two different units reporting to different members of the senior management; 
(b) separation into two different units reporting to the same member of the senior management; 
(c) separate staff within the same unit."|123
1807|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 15|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.6 General principles for internal validation|The decision on which organisational arrangement to adopt should take into account the nature, size and scale of the institution and the complexity of the risks inherent in its business model.|55
1808|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 16|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.6 General principles for internal validation|16. Consequently, the ECB understands that large and complex institutions should implement the most robust independence option.|42
1809|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 17|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.6 General principles for internal validation|17. With option (b) of paragraph 15, two different units report directly 14 to the same member of senior management, but act separately at any level below that. When using this second option, the institution should fulfil the additional requirements specified in Article 10(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439. The ECB considers it best practice if the institution fulfils Article 22(1)(e) of the Final draft RTS on assessment methodology for IMA and significant share. The internal audit should regularly assess whether these additional requirements are being met.|144
1810|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 18|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.6 General principles for internal validation|18. The ECB considers that option (c) of paragraph 15 could be suitable for small legal entities which are not classified as global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) or other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs). 15 When using this option, the institution should fulfil the additional requirements specified in Article 10(4) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439. The ECB considers it best practice if the institution fulfils Article 22(2) of the Final draft RTS on assessment methodology for IMA and significant share, and in particular that the internal audit regularly assesses that these additional requirements are met.|159
1811|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 19|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.6 General principles for internal validation|19. A proper separation of the staff of the development function from the staff of the validation function enables institutions to limit the risk of conflicts of interest resulting in an ineffective challenge from the validation. To mitigate this risk, the institution should ensure that the staff of the validation function is separate from the staff involved in the model development process.$^{16}$|91
1812|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 20|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.6 General principles for internal validation|20. The validation function 17 should be adequately staffed following the proportionality principle. It should have suitable resources and experienced,$^{18}$ qualified personnel (who have appropriate quantitative and qualitative knowledge) to enable it to conduct an effective independent challenge of the internal models and internal estimates and their performance.|82
1813|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 21|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.7 General principles for internal audit|21. The CRR requires internal models to be subject to regular review by the internal audit or another comparable independent auditing unit (hereinafter internal audit). 19 In the understanding of the ECB, also taking into account the EBA|69
1814|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 21|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.7 General principles for internal audit|Guidelines on internal governance$^{20}$, this regular review needs to be efficient and effective to meet that objective.|44
1815|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 22|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.7 General principles for internal audit|"22. To enable an objective assessment, the internal audit should be granted an adequate level of independence from the processes and units reviewed to ensure that: 
(a) there is an effective separation of the internal audit from the staff involved in the operations of the internal models, e.g. the validation function, the risk control unit and all other relevant business areas; 
(b) it reports directly to the management body$^{21}$; 
(c) no undue influence is exerted on the staff responsible for the audit conclusions."|126
1816|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 23|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.7 General principles for internal audit|"23. To enable a sufficient number and adequate scope of internal model reviews the internal audit should: 
(a) have adequate resources 22 and experienced, qualified personnel (with the appropriate quantitative and qualitative knowledge) to undertake all relevant activities; 
(b) be adequately equipped and managed in proportion to the nature, size and degree of complexity of the institution's business and organisational structure."|98
1817|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 24|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.7 General principles for internal audit|"24. In the follow-up process to the internal audit conclusions and findings and to ensure that the internal audit reviews have a timely and effective impact, the following are considered to be best practice: 
(a) Conclusions, findings and recommendations should be reported to the audit committee 23 and/or the appropriate 24 management level of the audited areas. 
(b) Where weaknesses are identified, action plans and related measures should be approved by the audit committee and/or the appropriate$^{25}$ management level of the audited areas. The internal audit function should monitor whether the audited areas implement the corrective measures in a timely manner. The institution should use appropriate information technology (IT) tools in order to ensure the effectiveness of the monitoring procedures. 
(c) Regular (at least annual) status reports should be prepared and the results discussed in the appropriate committees to ensure the timely and proper implementation of follow-up actions. Institutions should submit a summary of the outcomes of the relevant audit reports, action plans and the status of findings to the competent authority."|230
1818|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 25|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.8 General principles on climate-related and environmental risks|25. Institutions should assess the materiality of all risks in the life cycle of their internal models as set out in paragraph 2 of this chapter, including climaterelated and environmental risks. 26 Where climate-related and environmental risks drivers are found to be relevant and material, institutions should include such risk drivers in their internal models approved for use for the calculation of own funds requirements for credit and market risk.|107
1819|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 26|Other|General topics > 1 Overarching principles for internal models > 1.9 General principles for the implementation of a changed or extended model|"26. Under Article 3(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, institutions must calculate the own funds requirements based on the approved material change or extension from the date specified in the new permission (the ""implementation date"") which must replace the prior one. In general, it is expected that institutions will be capable of implementing the material change or extension in a timely manner upon receiving permission and in any case without undue delay. Therefore, when setting the implementation date, the ECB considers that the implementation should happen within a reasonable time frame starting from the date of the notification of the permission. 27 28 The ECB generally expects this time frame to be no longer than three months from the date of the notification. Exceptions to this expectation should be requested by the institution in question as early as possible (for example, when filing the application but not later than when submitting comments as part of the model decision process), which should provide reasons for the request, and can only be granted under specific circumstances (for instance in the case of an implementation requiring a staggered approach, such as the implementation across different jurisdictions, or in the case of joint implementation or of technical constraints inherent to the IT framework). 29 30 Note that the above guidance on the implementation date is given without prejudice to the expectations set out in Section 2.2.2 of the credit risk chapter of this guide. In addition, where there is a request to reverse the use of less sophisticated approaches in accordance with Article 149 of the CRR, the ECB equally expects that institutions will be capable of implementing the approach requested according to the same criteria defined above for material model changes and extensions."|368
1820|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 27|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.2 Application of the IRB approach|27. In accordance with Article 148 of the CRR, institutions must implement the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach for all exposures, unless they have received the permission of the competent authority to permanently use the standardised approach (SA) on some exposure classes or some types of exposures.|82
1821|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 28|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.2 Application of the IRB approach|"28. The criteria used to define the scope of application and sequential implementation of the IRB approach should be clearly documented and agreed with the competent authority. The ECB understands that these criteria include the following: 
(a) Quantitative aspects: as a minimum, the materiality and risk profile of the exposures and internal thresholds/ratios (for both exposure at default (EAD) value and risk-weighted exposure amounts (RWEAs)) for the initial and targeted IRB coverage. For institutions for which the ECB is the competent authority of the consolidated entity, the initial IRB coverage ratio (rating systems included in the initial IRB application) is expected to be above 50% (in terms of both EAD and RWEAs$^{32}$) at consolidated level. This takes into account that institutions must implement the IRB approach for all exposures included in the roll-out plan in a reasonable time period.$^{33}$ 
(b) Qualitative aspects: importance of the exposure classes or types of exposures for the institution's business model, data availability, operational capacity, staffing, length of experience and homogeneity of treatment of similar exposures."|253
1822|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 29|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.2 Application of the IRB approach|29. Institutions which have already received permission to use the IRB approach are also expected to reach a 50% minimum IRB coverage ratio (in terms of both EAD and RWEAs) in the implementation of the approved roll-out plan.|73
1823|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 30|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.2 Application of the IRB approach|30. The IRB approach can be implemented sequentially across the different exposure classes or types of exposures, across different business units or for the use of own estimates of losses given default (LGDs) and conversion factors (CCFs) (roll-out). The ECB considers that the time frame for the initially approved roll-out plan should generally not exceed five years.$^{34}$|98
1824|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 31|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.2 Application of the IRB approach|31. In the light of the ECB's need to know the regulatory treatment of all exposures for its ongoing supervision, institutions are expected to provide the competent authority with full transparency and regular communications regarding this treatment. 35 These communications should include information on all subsidiaries and all portfolios (together with clear exposure assignment criteria). Institutions should receive explicit permission from the competent authority to use the SA for exposure classes or types of exposures that are not in the scope of the IRB approach, following the requirements established under Article 150 of the CRR.|131
1825|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 32|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.2 Application of the IRB approach|"32. Decisions of the institutions on the application and sequential implementation of the IRB approach should be triggered by internal criteria (as defined in paragraph 28) with the main purpose of enhancing risk management and risk sensitivity. In particular, sequential implementation should not be selectively used for the purpose of achieving reduced own funds requirements.$^{36}$ 
· exposures covered under Article 150(1) paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (i) and (j) of the CRR; 
· exposures classified as ""other non-credit obligation assets"" and ""items representing securitisation positions"" under Article 147(2) paragraphs (f) and (g) of the CRR; 
· exposures classified as ""other items"" under Article 112(q) of the CRR."|186
1826|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 32|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.2 Application of the IRB approach|The rationale for these exclusions is to limit the scope to exposures for which the CRR envisages the implementation of a rating system.|49
1827|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 32|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.2 Application of the IRB approach|35 Under Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, the ECB can request all relevant information.|42
1828|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 33|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.2 Application of the IRB approach|33. If, as the result of a merger or other type of transaction, an entity becomes a parent entity or an entity that intends to apply the IRB, the IRB coverage ratio of the post-merger legal entity should meet the expectations set out in paragraph 28(a) of this chapter.|85
1829|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 34|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.3 Governance of the roll-out plan for the IRB approach|"34. ""All material aspects of the rating and estimation processes shall be approved by the institution's management body or a designated committee thereof and senior management."" 37 As the roll-out plan determines the intended application of the IRB approach and its sequential implementation, it too should be approved by the institution's senior management and management body (or a designated committee thereof)."|100
1830|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 35|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.3 Governance of the roll-out plan for the IRB approach|"35. As a corollary and in accordance with Article 189(2)(a) of the CRR, the ECB understands that the reporting by senior management on the status and progress of the sequential implementation of the IRB approach should be a regular agenda item for the management body or designated committee. The ECB would consider the following to be best practice: that the status of the rollout plan is reported frequently (at least annually) and that such reports include the exact scope of application (exposure class), the planned dates of approval and/or use, and the ""initial, current and planned"" 38 exposure amounts and RWEAs."|157
1831|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 36|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.3 Governance of the roll-out plan for the IRB approach|"36. To ensure compliance with Article 189(1) of the CRR with respect to the roll-out plan, institutions should have a framework or policy for the governance of their roll-out plan that includes, as mentioned above, the following: 
(a) indication of which internal bodies, including the management body or other committees and persons, are responsible for approving the roll-out plan and any changes to it; 
(b) the frequency of reporting on the implementation of the roll-out plan to the management body (or designated committee) and to the competent authority; 
(c) the criteria used for introducing changes to the roll-out plan (see also Section 2.4, below); 
(d) controls to assess compliance with the roll-out plan, for example second line of defence attestation or internal audit review (see also paragraph 92)."|197
1832|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 37|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.4 Changes to the roll-out plan for the IRB approach|37. Under Article 148(2) of the CRR, institutions are required to follow the roll-out plan approved by the competent authorities. In the event that a change in the approved roll-out plan is necessary, this change needs to be subject to a supervisory decision.|84
1833|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 38|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.4 Changes to the roll-out plan for the IRB approach|38. Article 7(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439 39 sets out the conditions under which competent authorities may approve any changes to the sequence and time period of the plan. The ECB intends to assess any application for a change to a roll-out plan against these conditions, on the basis of the documentation provided by the institution regarding the rationale for the change, the materiality of the portfolios affected, and governance arrangements for the change (e.g. which body will approve it). In addition, when assessing an application for a change to the roll-out plan, the competent authority will determine, if necessary, whether the proposed amendment to the time frame for the implementation of the roll-out plan is acceptable. If institutions have already completed the implementation of their roll-out plan but would like to extend the use of the IRB approach (for instance following a merger or acquisition), they should also seek approval 40 from the competent authority.|224
1834|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 39|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.4 Changes to the roll-out plan for the IRB approach|"39. Furthermore, institutions should pay attention to the following: 
(a) Resource constraints and re-prioritisation may affect their operational capability to develop and maintain rating systems. Institutions should seek to minimise disruptions to the implementation of the roll-out plan as a result of such factors, taking appropriate mitigation or contingency actions to demonstrate compliance with the CRR requirements. 
(b) General uncertainty caused by potential changes to the IRB regulatory requirements should not be considered a valid reason for changing the roll-out plan (or for delaying its implementation). If such regulatory changes take place and become binding, the institution can then reflect the impact on its plan by submitting a revised roll-out plan for approval."|164
1835|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 40|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.5 Monitoring of compliance with permanent partial use provisions|"40. Since permanent partial use (PPU) requires compliance with certain conditions, institutions need to ensure on an ongoing basis that exposures under PPU fall within the categories listed in Article 150(1) of the CRR. 41 To avoid a risk of non-compliance with these requirements, the ECB is of the view that institutions should implement the following: 
(a) Measures and triggers for a re-assessment of the suitability for PPU of PPU-authorised exposure classes, types of exposures or business units. Examples of measures that could be used include the number of obligors, EAD, proportion of group EAD, and average risk weight. 
(b) A reporting process monitoring the materiality (in terms of both EAD and RWEAs) of the exposure classes, types of exposures or business units in PPU over time. The PPU reporting should identify any changes in PPU exposures and RWEAs over time as well as the exposure classes, types of exposures or business units that are at risk of no longer fulfilling the PPU conditions. 
(c) Processes and guidelines to assess whether further exposure classes, types of exposures or business units - currently treated under the IRB approach - may become eligible for PPU (e.g. business in run-off or planned to be discontinued, excessive maintenance costs induced by the regulatory requirements vis-à-vis number of obligors)."|306
1836|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 41|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.5 Monitoring of compliance with permanent partial use provisions|41. Where a new type of exposure is created, the institution should verify if the new type of exposure (1) falls under the scope of an approved rating system, (2) falls under the scope of an approved permanent partial use of SA, and (3) requires any notification or request to the competent authority in line with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014. 42 Similarly, where a new business unit is created (e.g. consolidation of a new legal entity), institutions should verify the suitability for PPU according to the criteria established in their relevant internal policy, and take action accordingly.|152
1837|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 42|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.6 Reversion to a less sophisticated approach|42. Institutions that use the IRB approach for a particular exposure class or type of exposure may be permitted to stop using that approach and use the SA for the calculation of RWEAs instead if the conditions described in Article 149(1) and (3) of the CRR are met. 43 Similarly, institutions which have obtained permission to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors under Article 151(9) of the CRR may be permitted to revert to the use of LGD values and conversion factors referred to in Article 151(8) (the foundation-IRB (F-IRB) approach) if the conditions described in Article 149(2) and (3) of the CRR are met.|174
1838|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 43|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.6 Reversion to a less sophisticated approach|"43. In order to fulfil the requirements of Article 149 of the CRR, institutions should, among other things$^{44}$, document the rationale for reverting to a less sophisticated approach (the SA or the F-IRB approach). This means that an institution should document any reasons or impediments that arose after the original authorisation and led the institution to reconsider the use of an advanced approach. Depending on the features of the exposure class and/or type of exposure affected, institutions should in particular define and formalise objective and intuitive criteria for deciding which of the different approaches should be used for the calculation of own funds requirements across the whole portfolio. In doing so, they should take the following into account as part of a group-wide internal models strategy: 
(a) the required operational capability and cost for the institution to maintain a rating system for the respective exposure class and/or type of exposure in relation to the size of the institution and the strategic/non-strategic nature and scale of its activities; 
(b) the availability of minimum representative data for redeveloping a model or for developing another admissible approach (for example, in the case of reversion to the SA, institutions should first consider whether other admissible IRB approaches, such as the F-IRB or, where relevant, the approach under Article 153(5) of the CRR known as the supervisory slotting criteria approach (SSCA) could be developed without disproportionate effort); 
(c) where Article 149(1) of the CRR applies, the possibility of using another available IRB approach (such as the simple risk weight method for equity exposures); 
(d) the impact 45 of the reversion on own funds requirements by comparing: 
(i) the capital requirements produced by the approach currently used, including the effects of potential supervisory measures (such as limitations); 
(ii) the capital requirements produced by the use of the less sophisticated approach requested (the SA or the F-IRB approach)."|425
1839|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 43|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.6 Reversion to a less sophisticated approach|Where the reversion leads to a non-negligible reduction of capital requirements, institutions should provide convincing evidence that there is no intention to reduce own funds requirements.|56
1840|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 44|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.6 Reversion to a less sophisticated approach|44. Institutions should consistently apply across exposure classes and/or exposure types with similar features in terms of modelling (in particular with regard to points (a) and (b) of paragraph 43 above) the criteria defined to assess whether the requirements set out in Article 149(1) and (2) of the CRR have been met. Where a request is made to revert to a different approach (the SA or the F-IRB approach) for similar exposures of this kind, institutions are also expected to provide convincing evidence that the request is not being made in order to reduce own funds requirements. For instance, providing information on the own funds requirements (or a proxy of these requirements) produced by using another admissible approach for the related exposures may help to inform the assessment as to whether the request is being made in order to reduce own funds requirements.|196
1841|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 45|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.6 Reversion to a less sophisticated approach|45. Where institutions envisage several applications linked to a new internal model strategy, the ECB expects that submitting a single comprehensive and consistent request for all the rating systems in line with the strategy will usually ensure a more efficient assessment and approval process.|72
1842|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 46|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.6 Reversion to a less sophisticated approach|"46. More specifically, in the case of requests to revert to the SA for specialised lending exposures: 
(a) regarding the ""necessity"" condition referred to in Article 149(1)(a) of the CRR, namely that the reversion is necessary on the basis of nature and complexity of the institution's total exposures of this type, the institution should demonstrate that the use of the SSCA is not feasible or proportionate given, for example, the immateriality of the affected exposures, and that it can no longer build a rating system that would provide a meaningful differentiation of risk; 
(b) regarding the condition referred to in Article 149(1)(a) of the CRR that the use of the SA is not proposed in order to reduce the institution's own funds requirements, the impact on own funds requirements of using the SA should also be compared with the own funds requirements produced by using the SSCA (or a proxy of it), unless the institution has already provided sufficient convincing evidence that the use of this approach is not feasible."|237
1843|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 47|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.7 Internal models in the context of consolidations|47. The principles listed in this section are applicable to Pillar 1 internal models for credit, market and counterparty credit risk.|52
1844|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 48|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.7 Internal models in the context of consolidations|"48. The general treatment of internal models in the case of consolidations, i.e. mergers and acquisitions, is set out in Section 3.4 of the ECB's Guide on the supervisory approach to consolidation in the banking sector. Paragraph 36 of that document acknowledges that compliance issues regarding the continued use of internal models may arise in the event of a business combination. Paragraph 37 of the same document envisages the use of existing internal models in such cases ""subject to a clear model mapping and a credible internal models roll-out plan to address the specific internal model issues created through the merger, as well as other conditions where appropriate""."|154
1845|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 49|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.7 Internal models in the context of consolidations|49. In order to implement this guidance, a separate ECB decision is needed for each individual case, including details of compliance issues arising at the transaction date, the actions the institution will take to return to compliance$^{46}$, and necessary transitional arrangements related to the RWEA calculation while the return to compliance plan (see next paragraph) is implemented.|96
1846|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 50|Roll-out and permanent partial use|General topics > 2 Roll-out and permanent partial use > 2.7 Internal models in the context of consolidations|"50. Institutions are expected to submit a ""return to compliance plan"" explaining how they will return to compliance with regard to model-related compliance issues. The return to compliance plan should clarify the strategy that the bank will follow to restore compliance and should include details of the following in particular: 
· the internal models landscape of the banks participating in the merger, the use of internal model approaches or of the SA, and the scope of the models; 
· the target internal model landscape of the post-merger legal entity; 
· the concrete actions, with their associated timelines, that the bank plans to take to achieve the target internal model landscape, in particular model extensions, requests for initial model approvals and PPU requests; 
· how the post-consolidation legal entity intends to calculate RWEAs until the return to full compliance, taking into account the capability of the acquiring bank to use the models of the target, in particular before and after any potential IT integration."|219
1847|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 51|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.1 Relevant regulatory references|"51. The principles on internal governance have been organised along the following lines: 
(a) the materiality of rating systems (Section 3.2); 
(b) the management body and senior management: 
(i) decision-making responsibilities (Section 3.3); 
(ii) management reporting (Section 3.4); 
(iii) understanding of the rating systems (Section 3.5); 
(c) responsibilities of the credit risk control unit (CRCU) (Section 3.6)."|119
1848|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 52|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.2 Materiality of rating systems|52. Whether a rating system is material depends on quantitative criteria (such as the share of total EAD and RWEA covered by the material rating systems) and qualitative criteria (such as the type, riskiness and strategic importance of the exposures, the complexity of the rating systems and risk parameters, and the model risk - in alignment with the model risk management framework). The more material a rating system is, the higher are the risks resulting from any potential shortcomings in it. Consequently, materiality should be an essential consideration in model risk management and the rating systems classified as material by the institution should be subject to particular scrutiny.|143
1849|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 53|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.2 Materiality of rating systems|53. In line with the above, institutions should assess and determine the materiality of their rating systems and communicate it to the competent authority. Material rating systems should at least include the rating systems covering material types of exposure. As the classification of the rating systems according to their materiality may be subject to changes resulting from internal or external factors (e.g. changes in economic factors, changes in business strategy), institutions should review their classification on a regular basis.|109
1850|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 54|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.2 Materiality of rating systems|54. Although the same requirements apply to all rating systems throughout the model life cycle, additional requirements may apply to material rating systems, in particular with regard to management reporting (see Section 3.4 of this chapter) and internal validation (see Section 4.3 of this chapter). This concept, that additional requirements may apply for material rating systems, is supported by the higher potential risk resulting from material rating systems and by Article 189 of the CRR, which also embeds the concept of materiality.$^{48}$|124
1851|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 55|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.3 Decision-making responsibilities|55. In accordance with Article 189(1) of the CRR, material aspects of all rating and estimation processes must be approved by the institution's management body or a committee designated by it, as well as by senior management. 49 The ECB considers that Article 14(b) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439 provides a good understanding of the aspects that should at least be considered as material, and should therefore be approved at both levels.|114
1852|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 56|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.3 Decision-making responsibilities|56. The ECB understands that the approval process envisaged by Article 189(1) of the CRR should include the documentation of the approvals, so that they can be made available for review at the request of the institution's internal audit or the competent authority.|69
1853|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 57|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.3 Decision-making responsibilities|57. The institution should define which policies should be approved at both levels (management body and senior management) and this should be clarified in their respective mandates. At a minimum, the following should be considered as requiring approval at both levels: (i) risk management policies that could have a material impact on the institution's rating systems and risk estimates, and (ii) policies covering the risk of a third-party provider for model-related tasks ceasing to operate (in relation to IT infrastructure and contingency planning).$^{50}$|120
1854|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 58|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.3 Decision-making responsibilities|58. Senior management must provide notice to the management body or a designated committee thereof of material changes or exceptions from established policies. 51 Consequently, institutions should be able to demonstrate which material changes or exceptions from established policies are communicated to the management body or a committee designated by it, and how this is done. To ensure compliance with this provision each institution should, in the ECB's view, have a policy in place which defines material changes or exceptions. They may use quantitative and/or qualitative criteria to do so. The use of expert judgement within the classification process should be clearly explained and documented.|134
1855|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 59|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.4 Management reporting|59. To ensure consistent oversight of the functioning of the rating systems, the CRR requires management reporting on their performance.$^{52}$|42
1856|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 60|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.4 Management reporting|60. To comply with this reporting requirement, institutions should determine the level of detail of the information and data to be presented to senior management and the management body (or designated committee thereof), and the frequency of the reporting. In view of proportionality, the level of detail of the information and data and the frequency of reporting may differ depending on the recipient and the materiality of the rating systems concerned (see Section 3.2 of this chapter on the materiality of rating systems). Reports regarding non-material rating systems may be provided in a more aggregated form. The procedures encompassing reporting for non-material rating systems should be clearly defined in the institution's policies and differences with respect to the reporting of material rating systems should be clearly identified.|162
1857|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 61|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.4 Management reporting|61. The ECB considers that Article 15 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439 provides a good understanding of the elements to be included as part of the institution's management reporting. 53 In particular, these reports should include information regarding the materiality of each rating system, its perceived strengths and limitations, and its current status in the light of validation and/or audit actions.|97
1858|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 62|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.4 Management reporting|62. As regards the level of detail of content, reports to the management body are expected to be more concise than reports to senior management. They should, however, include the necessary information for sound and appropriate decision-|58
1859|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 62|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.4 Management reporting|52 See Article 189(2), sub-paragraph 2, and Article 189(3) of the CRR.|41

(ii) the migration across grades; 
(iii) an estimation of the relevant risk parameters per grade; 
(iv) a comparison of realised default rates, and, where own estimates are used, of realised LGDs and realised conversion factors against expectations;

(d) the management reporting is proportionate to the nature, size, and degree of complexity of the institution's business and organisational structure."" making. As regards frequency, institutions should provide reports to senior management as often as, or more frequently than, to the management body (or designated committee). Risk profiles and the comparison of estimated probability of default (PD) with realised default rates should be reported to senior management more frequently than annually (at least for material rating systems - see also paragraph 54) to enable senior management to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating systems are operating properly in accordance with Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR and to avoid risks that could justify supervisory measures."|241
1862|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 63|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.4 Management reporting|63. At least annually, both senior management and the management body should receive an aggregated overview of the validation results for each rating system (see also paragraph 82).|48
1863|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 64|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.5 Understanding of the rating systems|64. The management body must possess a general understanding of the rating systems and senior management must have a good understanding of the rating systems designs and operations. 54 Institutions should therefore be able to provide evidence of the processes they use to improve and maintain the management body and senior management's understanding of the rating systems, including those implemented after receiving permission to use the IRB approach.|93
1864|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 65|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.5 Understanding of the rating systems|65. The format and content of these processes (for example workshops, seminars or dedicated training on IRB models) should match the roles and responsibilities of the management body and senior management, in particular those related to the model approval process. Especially for the management body, an adequate balance between collective and individual knowledge should be ensured. In the case of third-party involvement (see Section 8 of this chapter), the institution should maintain adequate internal knowledge of the outsourced tasks.|112
1865|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 66|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.5 Understanding of the rating systems|66. While reporting or monitoring can be considered as part of the management body and senior management's knowledge-building process, it is expected that these will not be the only means of ensuring that they have an adequate understanding of the rating systems.|65
1866|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 67|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.5 Understanding of the rating systems|67. One outcome of an effective internal understanding of the rating system is that the management body or the designated committee should be able to hold an objective debate on, and challenge, the rating systems. This applies in particular to the approval of material changes or the escalation process contemplated in paragraph 84. In the ECB's view, it is best practice if the evidence of such debates is visible in the minutes of management body or designated committee meetings in which such a challenge is raised, as the management body or the designated committee should be able to discuss the outcomes, use, strengths and limitations of the IRB models.|140
1867|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 68|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.6 The credit risk control unit (CRCU)|68. To ensure that the CRCU is independent from the personnel and management functions responsible for originating and renewing exposures, 55 institutions should clearly determine which individuals and/or teams make up the credit risk control function and which personnel and/or units are responsible for originating and renewing exposures, 56 and why they are independent from one another. In addition, institutions need to ensure a direct line of reporting of the CRCU to senior management in accordance with Article 190(1) of the CRR.|123
1868|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 69|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.6 The credit risk control unit (CRCU)|69. Institutions should have a clear written mandate for their CRCU which clarifies its roles and responsibilities in order to ensure that they are aligned to the responsibilities mentioned in Article 190(2) of the CRR. Institutions should also determine which units are responsible for performing which subset of the tasks allocated to the CRCU(s), 57 especially those tasks related to model design and development and the ongoing monitoring of the rating systems.|108
1869|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 70|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.6 The credit risk control unit (CRCU)|70. The CRCU is responsible for ensuring the satisfactory performance of the rating systems and their ongoing maintenance. The CRCU may provide the validation function, when required and in line with paragraph 78, with the necessary input for the validation of internal estimates. In addition, the CRCU should address any deficiencies identified by the validation function and conduct the approved remediation activities as described in paragraph 83.|102
1870|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 71|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 3 Internal governance > 3.7 Review of estimates|"71. In accordance with Article 179(1)(c) of the CRR, risk estimates should be reviewed 58 when new information comes to light but at least on an annual basis. The ECB considers it best practice to do this on the basis of: 
(a) the ongoing monitoring performed by the CRCU; 
(b) the annual validation of internal estimates performed by the validation function (as described in Section 4 of this chapter)."|106
1871|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 72|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.1 Relevant regulatory references|"72. In the context of rating systems, the term ""validation"" encompasses a range of processes and activities that contribute to an assessment of whether ratings adequately differentiate risk, and whether estimates of risk parameters (such as PD, LGD and CCF) appropriately characterise the relevant aspects of risk."|75
1872|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 73|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.1 Relevant regulatory references|"73. The main role of the validation function is to perform a consistent and meaningful assessment of the performance of internal rating and risk estimation systems. The term ""validation function"" encompasses the personnel responsible for performing the validation."|59
1873|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 74|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.2 Validation level and responsibilities|"74. In general, internal validation should be performed at all relevant levels. In particular, institutions should pay attention to the following: 
(a) If the institution has approval for a rating system on a consolidated basis only, the validation of that rating system should be performed at least at consolidated level. 
(b) If the institution has approval for a rating system on a consolidated basis as well as on a sub-consolidated and/or individual basis, the validation of that rating system should be performed at the consolidated as well as on the sub-consolidated and/or individual levels. The results of the validation at the sub-consolidated and/or individual levels should be taken into account for consistency reasons in the validation performed at consolidated level."|163
1874|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 75|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.2 Validation level and responsibilities|75. In order to ensure consistency in validation activities across the different levels, the group validation function can provide support to validation functions at lower levels (sub-consolidated and/or individual level). However, responsibility for the validation tasks should be retained at the level at which the rating system is approved (sub-consolidated and/or individual level). See also Section 8.3.1 on internal and external outsourcing of internal validation and internal audit tasks and Section 8.3.5 on in-house knowledge of this chapter.|122
1875|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 76|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|76. To meet the requirements of Article 185 of the CRR with regard to the assessment of the performance of the internal rating and risk estimates by the validation function, the ECB understands that institutions should implement the following:|66
1876|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 77|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|77. Validation policy|26
1877|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 77|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|Institutions should have internal validation policies involving proven procedures and methods which adequately validate the accuracy, robustness and stability of their estimation of all relevant risk parameters. 61 The procedures and methods stipulated in the validation policy should be in line with the institution's classification of material and non-material rating systems as defined in paragraphs 52 and 54. Institutions should follow their internal validation policy when carrying out validations.|101
1878|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 78|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|"78. Validation process and content: 
(a) The validation process should assess the performance of the rating systems by means of qualitative and quantitative methods, in particular with regard to the ranking of borrowers by creditworthiness (ranking power) and risk parameter estimation (calibration appropriateness). 
(b) To be able to meaningfully and consistently assess the performance of the rating systems, the content of the validation process should be consistent across rating systems and through time. 62 The analyses and tests described in this paragraph should be considered as the minimum activities required to ensure that the assessment is meaningful. However, the implementation of all of these analyses and tests does not necessarily mean that the validation requirements according to CRR have been fulfilled, nor should it prevent the institution from developing additional tests when deemed relevant. 
(c) The content of the validation process should include quantitative analyses, which in turn should include thresholds. If such thresholds are breached, further investigation should be initiated and, if necessary, adequate measures or actions should be triggered. 
(d) All analyses and tests should be performed in such a way that the validation function is in a position to propose an effective and independent challenge to model development and use. To that end, the institution should ensure that the validation function has its own access to the relevant databases. 63 The results of the validation analyses and tests should be documented (validation report) and verifiable by third-party experts (e.g. the internal audit and the competent authority). This also includes the preparation of the validation data. 
(e) It is not expected that institutions develop a uniform validation process, as the relevant tests and their frequency may differ from one rating system to another (e.g. corporate vs. retail rating systems or material vs. nonmaterial rating systems). 
(f) To ensure that the systems in place to validate the accuracy and consistency of rating systems are sufficiently robust, 64 institutions should ensure that any statistical tests or confidence intervals that they use are appropriate from a methodological point of view and sufficiently conservative. 
(g) A meaningful validation of the rating systems requires (as also anticipated by Article 185(b) of the CRR with respect to certain elements) not only an initial validation but also assessment on a regular basis. In line with Article 185(b) of the CRR, these assessments should be carried out annually.$^{65}$ Therefore, the validation analyses listed hereinafter should be carried out annually, unless otherwise advised below. As mentioned in paragraph 14 the term ""initial validation"" in the guide refers to the validation of new models as well as the validation of material changes and extensions to approved models. In the case of material changes and extensions the validation should be conducted on those aspects directly or indirectly affected by the change.$^{66}$ 
(h) In addition, and to ensure a robust validation, the analyses should be performed by the validation function without considering input from the CRCU 67 unless otherwise specified below. 
(i) Back-testing$^{68}$"|624

1880|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 78|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|(ii.a) Analyses of discriminatory power for PD models should be designed to ensure that the ranking of obligors/facilities resulting from the rating methodology appropriately separates riskier and less risky obligors/facilities. 69 Similarly, analyses of discriminatory power for LGD (respective CCF) models should be designed to ensure that the LGD (respective CCF) model is able to discriminate between facilities with high values of LGD (respective CCF) and those with low values of LGD (respective CCF).|131
1881|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 78|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|(ii.b) These analyses should be performed at least at the level of the overall model and, when relevant, at the level of individual risk factors and other possible segments including, for example, scorecards and modules.|65

1883|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 78|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|"(iii.a) The data used to build the model must be representative of the actual obligors or exposures (Article 174(c) of the CRR). This should include the following checks: 
· Ensuring that the range of application of the model is in line with the approved one, in accordance with Article 143(3) of the CRR. Obligor characteristics should be compared for PD models, and facility types and characteristics should be compared for LGD and CCF models. 
· Monitoring the changes made to the definition of default, with the aim of identifying any changes that would affect the representativeness of the dataset with respect to the obligors or facilities within the range of application of the model. 
· Analysing lending standards or workout procedures, external market and economic conditions, and other relevant characteristics surrounding the model development process."|193

· assessment of downturn phases and the correct application of margins of conservatism."|105
1945|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 78|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|(xii.b) Not all of the above-mentioned qualitative analyses need to be performed annually, but institutions should have a clear policy in place defining the appropriate frequency of each assessment.|58
1946|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 79|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|79. The duration from the start (reference date of data) to the end (approval of the validation results) of the yearly validation should not be more than one year. Deviations from this requirement should be clearly justified and documented by the institution and also reported to senior management.|78
1947|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 80|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|"80. Quantitative thresholds (see paragraph 78(c)) should be set up for at least the following tests:

1948|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 81|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.3 Content and frequency of tasks of the validation function|81. In particular for tests where no thresholds are applied, a consistent qualitative assessment of the results should be performed and documented. In the event of a negative qualitative assessment, adequate measures or actions should be triggered.|64
1949|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 82|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.4 Reporting and follow-up|82. Institutions should ensure that senior management and the management body (or the committee designated by it) are informed about the conclusions and recommendations of the validation results as set out in the rating systems' validation reports, and in particular about any exceeded thresholds and deficiencies identified, as this is required by Article 189(2), sub-paragraph 2, of the CRR. Such information should be provided, where appropriate, 78 in a summary document (or documents) to ensure that a sufficient level of information is provided to senior management and to the management body and to enable them to assess the performance of the rating systems. This summary document (or documents) should present an aggregated view and comparison of the results for all the rating systems.|165
1950|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 83|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.4 Reporting and follow-up|83. Institutions should be able to demonstrate that, on the basis of the validation results and recommendations, measures are initiated to remedy the identified deficiencies of the rating systems (e.g. model change, recalibration) as contemplated by Article 189(2), sub-paragraph 2, of the CRR.|79
1951|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 84|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.4 Reporting and follow-up|84. Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR requires senior management to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating systems are operating properly. Article 189(2), sub-paragraph 2, of the CRR requires senior management to be informed of the status of the measures to remedy any previously identified deficiencies. From this, it can be inferred that institutions should have a process in place (e.g. through a committee or another comparable body) to decide on such measures, who will be responsible for them, and the timelines for their implementation, on the basis of the validation results and recommendations. To ensure sufficient senior management engagement as contemplated by Article 189(2) of the CRR, the ECB is of the view that at least for material rating systems the direct involvement of senior management should be envisaged (e.g. by senior management chairing the committee). The process should involve persons with the appropriate level of seniority and responsibility from both the CRCU and the validation function. If affected, business units should also be involved. An escalation process up to management body level should be in place in the event of conflicts between the validation function, the CRCU and/or business units.|261
1952|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 85|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.4 Reporting and follow-up|85. Institutions should have adequate processes in place for tracking the status of the measures adopted to remedy deficiencies.$^{79}$|41
1953|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 86|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 4 Internal validation > 4.4 Reporting and follow-up|86. Institutions should always apply to/notify the competent authority in the event of changes to their validation methodology and/or processes in accordance with Annex 1 Part 2 Section 1 (material model change) or Section 2 (ex ante notification) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014.|83
1954|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 87|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 5 Internal audit > 5.2 Scope and frequency of the review of the rating systems|87. In accordance with the existing regulatory requirements under Article 191 of the CRR, the internal audit or another comparable independent auditing unit (hereinafter internal audit) must review the institution's rating systems and its operations at least annually. The areas for review must include adherence to all applicable requirements.|83
1955|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 88|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 5 Internal audit > 5.2 Scope and frequency of the review of the rating systems|88. The ECB considers that an institution fulfils the above-mentioned requirements of Article 191 of the CRR if the internal audit carries out, annually and on the basis of up-to-date information, a general risk assessment of all aspects of the rating systems for the purpose of drawing up the appropriate internal audit work plan, as elaborated in paragraphs 89 to 91, and executes this plan.|105
1956|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 89|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 5 Internal audit > 5.2 Scope and frequency of the review of the rating systems|"89. Depending on the outcome of the general risk assessment, the intensity and frequency of the audit assignments 80 may differ between specific areas. 
(a) An area showing signs of increased/high risk in the general risk assessment is subject to a thorough audit assignment (""deep dive""). Reasons for the increased risk might include, but are not limited to, new processes, new regulatory requirements, new types of exposures in the range of application of a rating system, material model changes, findings by the competent authority or by any other function, open issues and areas with high risk identified in previous risk assessments. The audit assignments should be included in the annual audit work plan established on the basis of the general risk assessment. 
(b) Areas not showing any sign of an increased/high risk are subject to a deep dive mission at least every three years in order to provide a thorough update of the internal audit opinion on them.$^{81}$"|206
1957|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 90|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 5 Internal audit > 5.2 Scope and frequency of the review of the rating systems|"90. For the purpose of the general risk assessment, the internal audit should develop its own opinion on the areas of rating systems to be reviewed but can take into consideration the analysis performed by the internal validation function where appropriate. This general risk assessment should include at least the opinion of the internal audit unit on the following aspects: 
(a) The development 82 and performance 83 of the rating systems. 
(b) The use of the models. The assessment of model use shows that the rating systems play an essential role in the most significant areas of the institution's risk management, decision-making, credit approval, internal capital allocation and corporate governance functions. 
(c) The process for the materiality classification, 84 the impact assessment and the compliance with regulatory requirements of all changes to the rating systems as well as their consequent implementation. The internal audit is informed of all changes to the rating systems. 
(d) The quality of the data used for the quantification of risk parameters. 
(e) The integrity of the rating assignment process. 
(f) The validation function, in particular with regard to its independence from the CRCU as described in paragraphs 17 and 18 of this chapter, as well as the scope and suitability of the tasks performed and outputs obtained. 
(g) The process for calculating own funds requirements."|287
1958|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 91|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 5 Internal audit > 5.2 Scope and frequency of the review of the rating systems|91. The procedures and results of the general risk assessment and prioritisation, the annual work plan, the guidelines, and the subsequent production of the internal audit reports should be properly documented and approved by the management body. The auditing techniques used and applied by the institution should be documented to ensure that assessments are consistent.$^{85}$|88
1959|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 92|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 5 Internal audit > 5.2 Scope and frequency of the review of the rating systems|92. To avoid delays in the procedures related to an initial IRB application or an application to extend the IRB approach to an exposure class or a type of exposure that is currently treated using the SA, it is beneficial if the internal audit provides the competent authority with an independent assessment of the compliance of the initial IRB application or extension package with all applicable requirements. This applies in particular to compliance with the experience test requirements of Article 145 of the CRR. The benefit of carrying out an internal review of this nature is that shortcomings can be addressed by the institution before submitting the application, and the completeness of the initial IRB application or extension package can be ensured.|157
1960|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 93|Governance, validation and audit|General topics > 5 Internal audit > 5.2 Scope and frequency of the review of the rating systems|93. For extensions and changes to the IRB approach, 86 institutions must submit, among other things, and together with the application, reports of their independent review or validation. 87 In the case of material changes in the validation methodology and/or validation processes or process-related aspects of changes in the definition of default, the review of those aspects should be independently assessed by the internal audit function.|102
1961|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 94|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 6 Model use > 6.2 Use test requirement|94. The ECB acknowledges that the degree of use of internal ratings and default and loss estimates in the institution's risk management and decision-making process, and in its credit approval, internal capital allocation and corporate governance functions, is more extensive for PD/internal ratings than for LGD/loss estimates and CCFs.|78
1962|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 95|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 6 Model use > 6.2 Use test requirement|95. Moreover, the IRB risk parameters can be used in an adjusted form or indirectly through relevant risk measures/indicators stemming from the rating systems, provided that differences from the regulatory parameters are fully justified and properly documented. 89 For example, institutions may use adjusted or transformed IRB parameters by removing certain constraints (e.g. downturn effect, conservative add-on, floor) or adjusting the time horizon.|98
1963|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 96|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 6 Model use > 6.2 Use test requirement|96. The use of IRB risk parameters and their inclusion in internal policies and procedures enables institutions to continuously improve their accuracy and reliability by receiving feedback from model users. The conditions for an effective and beneficial feedback loop include a good understanding of the model, its assumptions and constraints and an adequate level of interaction between users, the CRCU and the validation function.|87
1964|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 97|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 6 Model use > 6.2 Use test requirement|97. Where an institution requests initial permission to use the IRB approach or initial permission to use own estimates of LGD or CCF in the context of sequential implementation of the IRB approach, the institution should provide evidence that rating systems which are broadly in line with the IRB requirements of the CRR have been used for risk management, decisionmaking and credit approval processes for at least three years as part of the prior experience requirement set out in Article 145(1) and (2) of the CRR and Article 22 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439.|139
1965|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 98|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 6 Model use > 6.2 Use test requirement|"98. Where an institution makes a request to extend the IRB approach to a new legal entity (that is not yet using the IRB approach) or to extend it to additional exposures, Article 145(3) of the CRR provides that if the use of the rating systems is extended to exposures that are significantly different from the scope of existing coverage, such that the existing experience cannot be reasonably assumed to be sufficient to the requirements of Article 145(1) and (2) of the CRR, the institution should provide evidence that the requirements of Article 145(1) and (2) of the CRR have been met. If the use of the rating systems is extended to additional exposures that are not significantly different from the scope of the existing coverage, it is the ECB's understanding that: 
(a) if the request is for calculation of own funds requirements at consolidated level only, the conditions of Article 145(1) and (2) of the CRR may be considered as having been met considering the existing experience of the institution; 
(b) if the request is for calculation of own funds requirements at consolidated and individual levels, the institution should provide evidence that the conditions of Article 145(1) and (2) of the CRR have been met for the new legal entity."|280
1966|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 98|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 6 Model use > 6.2 Use test requirement|Where, following the consolidation and while the institution is returning to compliance, a single exposure is in the scope of the IRB rating systems of the acquirer and of the target, the institution should have appropriate processes in place to prevent a rating system from being used for the purpose of reducing own funds requirements.|76
1967|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 99|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 6 Model use > 6.3 Risk management, credit approval and decision-making process|99. As set out in Article 144(1)(b) of the CRR, internal ratings and default and loss estimates produced by the rating systems must play an essential role in the risk management and decision-making process and in credit approval. To ensure that they are able to play this essential role, institutions should use internal ratings and default and loss estimates in the approval, restructuring and renewal of credit facilities, and in lending policies and the monitoring process for obligors and exposures. This should be formally included in the institution's internal policies.|130
1968|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 99|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 6 Model use > 6.3 Risk management, credit approval and decision-making process|"The ECB considers that institutions comply with the requirement to use the internal ratings and default and loss estimates in the approval, restructuring and renewal of credit facilities if they establish the following: 
(i) Institutions incorporate the internal rating systems in the overall credit granting, restructuring and renewal process. Related policies are calibrated on the basis of rating classes or groups of rating classes or risk parameters. 
(ii) For the incorporation of internal rating systems to be beneficial, staff involved in the credit granting, restructuring and renewal process need to have sufficient knowledge of the rating systems, including their strengths and limitations. This encompasses the inclusion of rating system users' feedback in model development and maintenance as well as having appropriate training programmes in place.

In addition, institutions should consider taking into account the internal ratings and default and loss estimates produced by the rating systems in the five areas shown below. If an institution decides to take into account the internal ratings and default and loss estimates in any of these five areas, this should be formally included in its internal policies. 90 If an institution is not using internal ratings or risk parameters in one or several of these areas, it should properly document and justify the rationale for that to ensure that discrepancies are explained in a sound and understandable manner. 
(i) Internal ratings and risk estimates can be considered in the pricing of transactions, in particular for non-retail exposures. 
(ii) The methodology underlying pricing can be documented and the use of risk-adjusted performance indicators (e.g. return on risk-adjusted capital - RORAC) or adjusted IRB parameters is considered best practice for pricing estimation. 
(b) Early warning systems 
(i) Early warning systems can be applied to all the institution's exposures and can be tailored to its specific sub-portfolios (with at least a distinction between retail and non-retail exposures). 
(ii) PD/ratings dynamics (i.e. downgrades) and other indicators linked to other risk measures (e.g. EL, loan-to-value, overdraft) can be taken into account in the institution's early warning system - at least for the most relevant portfolios. Whenever an anomaly is detected, appropriate risk management decisions can be triggered. This process can be adjusted depending on the persistency and intensity of the warning. It can also be designed according to other variables such as exposure size or facility type. 
(c) Collection and recovery policies and processes 
(i) Regarding the collection process, institutions can have risk management procedures in place which are triggered in advance of the exposure's default (e.g. early collection calls) and are based among other indicators - on their internal ratings or risk drivers. 
(ii) Regarding the recovery process, institutions can have in place rules, strategies or procedures that take into consideration, inter alia, their"|436

(i) The credit risk adjustments methodology for both performing exposures and exposures in default (or share of exposures in default) can be aligned to the calculation of own funds requirements, although some adjustments might be needed to comply with accounting standards (for example, International Financial Reporting Standards 9 (IFRS 9)). The institution should justify and document any significant deviations to ensure that the rationale for discrepancies is sound and understandable. 
(e) Allocation or delegation of competence for the approval process 
(i) Along with the materiality of credit lines, the delegation of competences for credit approval can take risk estimates into account through one or several IRB parameters or through EL (for example, an increase of some EL-driven measures above a pre-defined threshold should typically trigger an escalation process). 
(ii) The allocation and delegation process can include the criterion of proportionality, taking into account portfolio risk and facility types."|221

Article 144(1)(h) of the CRR requires institutions to assign and continue with assigning each exposure in the range of application of a rating system to a rating grade or pool of this rating system. Furthermore, and in accordance with Article 173(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions must review those assignments at least annually. Nevertheless, the ECB observes that institutions' portfolios occasionally show a certain proportion of non-rated exposures and/or outdated ratings. The ECB considers that this should be properly investigated, justified, documented and monitored. 
(a) Root causes 
(i) Non-rated exposures are temporary exceptions to the ""ordinary"" rating assignment process and should therefore be investigated, documented and justified in detail. 
(ii) Outdated ratings include both ratings that have not been updated within the 12-month period following the last rating date 96 and ratings based on outdated information.$^{97}$ 
(b) Materiality 
(i) Non-rated exposures and outdated ratings present a risk for institutions of not being compliant with the CRR requirements related to rating systems. To mitigate that risk, institutions should implement specific policies and procedures to identify these non-rated exposures and outdated ratings and monitor their materiality (in terms of number, EAD and RWEAs). A formal check should be carried out on these issues, at least annually, and reported to senior management. These items should also be reviewed periodically by the internal validation function."|321

With regard to ratings not updated within the 12-month period following the most recent rating date, a transition period during which the current rating is carried forward can be considered provided all the following conditions are met: 
(a) the transition period begins 12 months after the date the current rating was assigned or when new material information on the obligor or exposure became available (if earlier); 
(b) the transition period does not exceed three months; 
(c) the transition period applies: 
(i) to wholesale exposures whose rating assignment relies on external information (e.g. financial statements), which may be available/published not exactly 12 months apart; or 
(ii) in the presence of exceptional internal impediments that affect the timely review of the rating assignment; 
(d) adequate monitoring and reporting policies, together with escalation procedures, are implemented to ensure a rapid return to compliance; restrictions to credit granting or to delegation of powers for credit approval are also envisaged for those counterparties whose rating falls within the transition period;

All exposures within the range of application 98 of an IRB rating system must eventually be rated 99 and are not expected to be treated under the SA, unless they have received the permission of the competent authority to be permanently treated under that approach in accordance with Article 150 of the CRR. 100 Nonrated exposures and outdated ratings present a risk of potential underestimation of own funds requirements. To mitigate that risk, institutions should adhere to the following guidance: 
(a) Institutions should have internal policies in place establishing a process to monitor and manage non-rated exposures and outdated ratings prudentially. In particular, they should be able to prove that their procedures allow for a conservative measure of risk, such as timedependent downgrading for outdated ratings and the application of the worst-performing rating grade for unrated exposures.$^{101}$

For the purposes of this subsection, instances of overruling of internal policies and/or procedures are not considered as overrides. If institutions overrule internal policies and/or procedures, they should, as in the case of overrides, document these instances and report them to the relevant functions (e.g. CRCU, internal validation function).

""For grade and pool assignments institutions shall document those situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process."" 102 Accordingly, institutions should have documented policies that incorporate the following principles: 
(a) the policies include clear and exhaustive justifications for triggering the override process on the basis of pertinent and significant information for an accurate assessment of the counterparty's creditworthiness; 
(b) the policies define the maximum extent of overrides (in terms of, for example, maximum number of notches up 103 and maximum share of overridden exposures), also considering model/portfolio specificities; institutions should aim to be more restrictive with positive overrides than with negative ones."|166

""Institutions shall analyse the performance of those exposures whose assignments have been overridden."" 105 To comply with this requirement, the institutions should carry out the following procedures: 
(a) Performance analysis of the rating systems, to assess whether the judgemental adjustments improve their discriminatory power. The analysis may be extended to all of the underlying components (modules) of the rating system. It is deemed particularly useful to measure the difference in terms of performance and impact of the ""pre-override"" and ""post-override"" stages. 
(b) Other analyses, including the assessment of the distribution of overrides by override root cause, i.e. if there is a situation that systematically triggers an adjustment and that could justify an adjustment to the model (for example the inclusion of a specific risk driver)."|188

To mitigate the risks identified through the aforementioned analysis (paragraph 112), institutions should identify specific criteria for assessing whether or not the number of and justifications for overrides indicate significant weaknesses in the rating system and whether this is a reason to take ad hoc actions (e.g. a model change). In general, situations where there are too many overrides could be a strong indicator of weaknesses in the model (i.e. systematic and material adjustments can be the consequence of a misspecification of the model).|131

In addition, as required by Annex 1, Part 2, Section 1 of this Regulation and to ensure consistency, the following should be observed: 
(i) the institution should specify metrics and significance levels that define the significance/materiality of changes in the distribution across rating grades produced by changes to the rating methodology (paragraph 2(d)(ii) of Annex 1, Part 2, Section 1); these metrics and significance levels should be complementary to those of Article 4(2) and (3) and Article 5(2) of the same Regulation;

(iii) the institution should specify metrics and significance levels that define the significance/materiality of changes in the rank ordering of clients/exposures (paragraph 2(d)(i) of Annex 1, Part 2, Section 1); 
(iv) in its change policy, the institution should define which changes constitute a change in the fundamental methodology for estimating PDs, LGDs (including best estimate of EL) and CCFs and are considered as material in the sense of paragraph 2(f) of Annex 1, Part 2, Section 1 (as opposed to the changes referred to in paragraph 2(h) of Annex 1, Part 2, Section 2); 
(v) the institution's change policy should include a definition of changes in the validation methodology and/or validation processes which lead to changes in its judgement of the accuracy and consistency of the estimation of the relevant risk parameters, the rating processes or the performance of the rating systems (paragraph 4 of Annex 1, Part 2, Section 1). 
(c) Procedures to identify and monitor changes, and to notify and apply to the competent authorities for permission to make such changes. In particular, institutions should establish an end-to-end process from identification to notification/application and describe how they perform the activities at each step. 
(d) Procedures for the implementation of changes, including their documentation; in particular, the re-rating process should be defined (if no other document is already in place)."|683

To facilitate the process for submitting the documentation package defined under Article 8 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, on the ECB Banking Supervision website the ECB has made available to institutions standardised templates for notifying ex ante and ex post non-material changes/extensions and for submitting applications for material model changes/extensions. Institutions are invited to use these templates to facilitate the process and to ensure consistency and completeness.$^{108}$|111
2014|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 118|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.4 Classification|"118. For the reasons mentioned in paragraph 115, institutions should have processes in place which specify, in detail, that the classification of a change/extension is adequate and consistent with the classification of other changes/extensions. The institution should ensure that the classification process is not subject to any arbitrage. In line with Article 3(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, ""one material extension or change shall not be split into several changes or extensions of lower materiality"". Similarly, an extension or change that requires notification before its implementation (ex ante) should not be split into several changes or extensions to produce one that is notified after implementation (ex post). Nor should several unrelated changes/extensions be combined to produce one change of lower materiality (e.g. two different model changes that affect RWEAs in opposite ways)."|194
2015|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 119|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.4 Classification|"119. In accordance with Article 3(4) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, ""in case of doubt institutions shall assign extensions and changes to the category of the highest potential materiality""."|68
2016|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 120|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.4 Classification|120. To ensure the accuracy of the impact assessment and the correctness and consistency of the resulting classification, the institution should establish a foureye principle. This means that the assessment and classification should be confirmed by a unit independent of the one responsible for the assessment and classification of the change/extension.|79
2017|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 121|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.5 Impact assessment|121. The impact assessment process must fulfil the requirements of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014. It should consist of a quantitative and a qualitative assessment.|58
2018|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 122|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.5 Impact assessment|122. The quantitative assessment focuses on the impact of the change or extension on RWEAs. Before and after the change or extension the institution should calculate the difference in these amounts for credit and dilution risk associated with the range of application of the internal rating system.|74
2019|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 123|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.5 Impact assessment|"123. This quantitative impact assessment is based on the specifications of Article 4(2) and (3) and Article 5(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014. The institution should use transparent definitions and internal procedures. 
(a) The institution should document the relevant reference date on which the calculations are based. In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, the institution should use the most recent data available. In the case of material change or ex ante notification the time between the reference date and the date of notification should not exceed nine months.$^{109}$ 
(b) The institution should give a precise definition of the range of application of the rating system applied in the calculations as referred to in Article 4(1)(c) and Article 5(1)(a)(iii) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014. It should ensure that the change to the IRB approach is directly related to exposures within the range of application of the rating system. 
(c) The institution should generally perform a precise impact assessment$^{110}$ (all exposures of the relevant range of application) when the rating system is automatic and does not require any human judgement of the qualitative variables (e.g. behavioural scoring). 
(d) If the institution applies Article 3(2)(b) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 and performs an impact assessment based on the re-rating of a representative sample of the population (only possible for rating systems that require qualitative assessment to define the final rating/score), this sample and its relation to the population should be described in detail (number of observations/exposures, minimum/maximum exposure amount, mean/median exposure amou nt, fir st/third quartile). The representativeness of the sample should be documented. 
(e) If the institution applies Article 3(2)(b) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 and performs an impact assessment based on other reliable inference methodologies, these methods should be described in detail and their reliability corroborated by qualitative and quantitative means."|477
2020|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 124|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.5 Impact assessment|124. The qualitative assessment is based on the specifications of Article 4(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(1)(a) points (i) and (ii) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014, which refer to the Annex I of that same Regulation. The institution should thoroughly examine each of these criteria. In addition, as reported in the change policy and to ensure consistency, institutions should examine the metrics and significance levels for the impact assessment and threshold calculation (see also Section 7.2, content of the change policy).|142
2021|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 125|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.5 Impact assessment|125. If a criterion specified in Annex 1 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 may be applicable a priori (and within reason) to a change or an extension and the institution's assessment concludes that this particular criterion is not fulfilled, the institution should document this conclusion in the notification.|87
2022|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 126|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.5 Impact assessment > 7.5.1 User acceptance test|126. To avoid the risk of having unexpected consequences in the use of the changed rating system (e.g. altered role of the changed rating system in the risk management of credit exposures), institutions should assess and document the impact of a material change/extension on the use of the parameters and ensure that the related internal policies and procedures for the areas described in Section 6.3 of this chapter remain relevant.|112
2023|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 127|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.5 Impact assessment > 7.5.1 User acceptance test|127. In the context of rating systems which contain qualitative inputs and/or any expert judgement component, the exposures of the representative sample referred to in point (d) of paragraph 123 should be fully re-rated under the amended rating system (including the material change or extension); adherence to the entire rating assignment process should be ensured. The feedback received from users on the application of the amended rating system and on the rating results is expected to be analysed and documented.|122
2024|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 128|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.5 Impact assessment > 7.5.1 User acceptance test|128. Changes or extensions that are classified as non-material do not generally require the preparation of a use test sample, unless there is evidence of a potential impact on the use of the parameters.|69
2025|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 129|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.6 Re-rating process|129. Where competent authorities have provided their permission in relation to a material extension or change, Article 3(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 requires institutions to calculate their own funds requirements on the basis of this approved extension or change from the date specified in the new permission. The ECB understands that this process (i.e. the re-rating process) should be covered in the institution's change policy.|112
2026|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 130|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.6 Re-rating process|130. Re-rating refers to the computation of a rating using the changed or extended rating system and the assignment of this new rating to an obligor previously rated using the rating system as it was before the change or extension.|66
2027|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 131|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.6 Re-rating process|131. In the context of changes or extensions that are classified as material, the change policy should ensure that the re-rating process is immediate. All former ratings and estimates should therefore be replaced by ratings and estimates calculated using the changed or extended model from the date specified in the approval decision - if the conceptual design allows this. This applies, for example, to rating systems that are exclusively based on behavioural scoring or in the case of recalibration not affecting the rating process.|115
2028|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 132|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.6 Re-rating process|"132. If an immediate re-rating is not possible (for example if the rating assignment requires new manual input and human judgement), and only for non-retail rating systems, the policy should ensure the following: 
(a) The obligors/exposures/facilities are rated using the amended rating system within the time frame of the yearly re-rating process, i.e. within a maximum of 12 months. 
(b) To mitigate the risk of underestimation of own funds requirements, in the event that a material change would lead to a material increase in the RWEA (i.e. more than 10% on the range of application of the rating system subject to change), the institution should apply the RWEA impact, simulated on the basis of the representative sample. The impact thus produced is the positive difference between the simulated RWEA after the material change and the RWEA before the material change approved by the competent authority. This should be done at the first Common Reporting date after the date of implementation."|228
2029|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 132|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.6 Re-rating process|"For the purpose of point (b) above, the ECB would consider the following approach as the most appropriate: 
· apply the simulated RWEA impact until all exposures within the range of application are rated using the changed model; 
· remove the simulated RWEA impact linearly, i.e. 25% every quarter."|88
2030|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 133|Model application, use, review and changes|General topics > 7 Management of changes to the IRB approach > 7.6 Re-rating process|133. The re-rating process for changes/extensions that are classified as non-material may take up to one year from the date of implementation.|49
2031|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 134|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.2 Preliminary principles|"134. Outsourcing, as defined in the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing, refers to an authorised entity's use of a third party (the ""service provider"") to perform activities that would normally be undertaken by the authorised entity itself, now or in the future. For the purposes of this section, outsourcing in the context of IRB models refers to the involvement of third parties in any IRB-related tasks, including data provisioning and the use of external data (e.g. development data, calibration data, external ratings as input for internal models, pooled data). The specific case of delegation of IRB-related tasks to different legal entities within the same group (internal outsourcing) is also considered as outsourcing and hence is subject to the expectations set out below.$^{112}$"|169
2032|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 135|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.2 Preliminary principles > 8.2.1 Contract requirements|135. All outsourcing arrangements for IRB-related tasks should be subject to a formal and comprehensive contract or similar documented agreement in accordance with the proportionality principle (in the case of internal outsourcing between different entities within the same group, provisions such as service level agreements (SLAs) or other written agreements may be considered as sufficient, subject to the criticality or importance of the tasks outsourced). Outsourcing institutions should take into account the aspects set out in Section|117
2033|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 135|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.2 Preliminary principles > 8.2.1 Contract requirements|"13 of the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing when preparing written outsourcing contracts. To avoid operational risks which could hinder the performance and operations of the rating systems, outsourcing agreements should provide for the following: 
(a) The agreed terms do not impede the institution in performing its validation activities. 
(b) The agreed terms do not impede the necessary communication between the institution and the competent authorities in performing their supervisory duties. In this sense they should include: 
(i) full and timely access for competent authorities to all information required (e.g. all of the models' development details, where an externally developed rating system is used); 
(ii) a requirement for the third party to provide support to the institution in the event of a request for information by the competent authority. 
(c) The agreed terms should ensure that the provider gives the institution access to relevant information in order to maintain sufficient in-house knowledge. The delivery of training and workshops is considered best practice."|217
2034|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 136|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.1 Internal validation and internal audit tasks|136. Although institutions are allowed to delegate some of their tasks, activities and functions to a third party, this should be done in accordance with all existing legal requirements and after due consideration of this guide, in particular the principles relating to internal validation and the internal audit included in this general topics chapter. If an institution plans to delegate certain internal validation or internal audit tasks to a third party that would perform them outside the EU, it should discuss this plan with the competent authority in advance.|131
2035|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 137|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.1 Internal validation and internal audit tasks|137. The ECB considers that responsibility for delegated tasks should be retained by the outsourcing institution. 113 This understanding is also expressed in paragraph 35 of the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing.|72
2036|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 138|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.1 Internal validation and internal audit tasks|"138. To ensure consistency in the content, quality and governance of the activities performed internally and externally, the ECB understands that the following practices in particular should be observed: 
(a) Reports should carry the logo and name of the institution and of the third party performing the tasks. 
(b) Reports should be approved by the senior management and the members of the management body (or the designated committee thereof) responsible for the function within the institution. 
(c) The institution should assess the quality/performance of the outsourced tasks. 
(d) The independence requirements set out in Section 1.6 for internal validation and Section 1.7 for internal audit of this chapter also apply to external parties. Institutions must ensure that model reviews are independent and free from any undue influence, also when performed by third parties. In this respect institutions should establish independence guidelines/policies with regard to third parties and those participating in internal model tasks equivalent to the internal guidelines and rules set internally. In particular, third parties and individuals that have performed or are currently performing model development or CRCU tasks should not perform model validation tasks within the same institution until a prudent cool-off period has elapsed.$^{114}$,$^{115}$"|275
2037|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 139|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.2 Use of external credit risk parameters/ratings|"139. Although institutions are allowed to use external credit risk parameters as a component of their rating systems, the following practices should be observed: 
(a) Internal ratings and estimates methodology should also take internal information into account. 116 When institutions use external ratings or parameters, they should ensure that these are incorporated in their estimation process in an appropriate manner and adjusted in accordance with the specificities of the institution.$^{117}$ 
(b) Analogously to the requirements for data pooled across institutions, 118 the institution should demonstrate good knowledge of the work performed by the third party in producing the estimates. In particular, the institution should demonstrate a good understanding of the data cleansing process, assumptions used, methodological choices and resulting limitations. The institution should also monitor the performance of the rating systems involved and be able to audit them, and have clear triggers for requesting a model review."|210
2038|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 140|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.3 Model development and maintenance|140. When institutions delegate the development and/or maintenance of internal models, this should be done in accordance with all existing regulatory requirements and the institutions' internal guidelines and policies, also taking this guide into account. If an institution plans to delegate such tasks to a third party that would perform them outside the EU, it is encouraged to discuss this with the competent authority in advance.|107
2039|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 141|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.3 Model development and maintenance|"141. As the ultimate model owners and users, institutions should do the following: 
(a) maintain an appropriate level of in-house knowledge (see Section 8.3.5 of this chapter); 
(b) have a robust contingency plan in place to ensure that they are prepared for the risk that could derive from insufficient maintenance of the rating systems."|103
2040|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 142|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.4 Use of pool models|142. In accordance with Article 179(2)(d) of the CRR, an institution using pool models must remain responsible for the integrity of its rating systems. In particular, the institution is ultimately responsible for the performance of the internal validation activities as elaborated in Section 4 of this chapter.|94
2041|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 143|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.4 Use of pool models|143. To comply with the requirement to ensure integrity of the rating system specified in Article 179(2)(d) of the CRR, if deficiencies are identified in the pooled rating system at institution level, the institution should be able to independently trigger a procedure designed to amend the system, if necessary, at individual or pool level. This applies regardless of the performance of the rating system at the pool level or at the level of the other participating institutions.|124
2042|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 144|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.4 Use of pool models|144. Where a third party is involved in the tasks of developing a rating system and risk estimation for an institution, the institution should verify that the validation activities with regard to those rating system and those risk estimates are not performed by that third party. Where, for the purpose of developing a rating system and risk estimation, the institution uses data that is pooled across institutions and a third party is developing the rating system, the third party may assist the institution in its validation activities by performing those tasks of validation which require access to the pooled data.$^{119}$|143
2043|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 145|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.5 In-house knowledge|145. To ensure that institutions are able to identify, manage and monitor the risks connected with internal models, they should maintain adequate in-house knowledge and core competence, as they are ultimately responsible for outsourced tasks and functions. Institutions should have access to all relevant information; this will enable them to take direct control of an outsourced activity in extremis. Best practice to ensure that this in-house knowledge is maintained includes ad hoc training at all levels (not only at management level) and proper oversight of the outsourced activities.|136
2044|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 146|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.5 In-house knowledge|"146. In the relationship with the third party, and for the purpose of maintaining appropriate in-house knowledge and responsibilities, the ECB would consider the following practices as being advisable in the event of third-party involvement in IRB-related tasks: 
(a) the terms of the contract include transparency requirements; 
(b) the institution has full access to all relevant information regarding internal model-related topics; 
(c) the institution receives regular reports; 
(d) on request, the institution is provided with specific reports; 
(e) on request, the third party provides support and attends interviews with the competent authorities."|150
2045|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 147|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.5 In-house knowledge|"147. In cases where third parties are involved in model (re-)development and/or parameter (re-)calibration, to ensure that the institution maintains sufficient inhouse knowledge and an adequate understanding of the rating system or that part of the rating system obtained from the third party$^{120}$, the ECB would consider the following practices as being advisable with regard to both the methodology and the data used for (re-)development and (re-)calibration: 
(a) The institution has access to all relevant information that enables it to understand the main model assumptions and risk estimation processes. 
(b) The institution has access to its own obligors' information. 
(c) In cases where pooled or external data are used for model development or calibration, the institution is able to assess to what degree the portfolio on which the model is based/developed is representative of its own portfolio, for the purposes of risk differentiation and risk quantification. 
(d) The institution has sufficient knowledge of the definition of default applied for the purposes of risk differentiation and risk quantification. 
(e) The institution has access to all necessary information to enable it to perform independent validation, including the validation of the model assumptions and performance of its own portfolio. 
(f) The institution has a specific change policy in place for models developed by third parties. 
(g) The institution is able to assess the need for a model change. The criteria that trigger a model change should be reflected in both the institution's model change policy and the contract with the third party, to ensure that the institution is able to make or request changes to the models."|354
2046|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 148|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.6 Independent monitoring of third-party performance|148. To ensure that it is able to identify and manage the risks connected with internal model-related outsourced tasks, the institution should also independently monitor the performance of third parties and have appropriate processes in place in this regard. This practice reinforces the fact that the institutions are the ultimate users of the rating systems and thus have the ultimate responsibility for their operations.|105
2047|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 149|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.6 Independent monitoring of third-party performance|"149. The following are considered by the ECB as best practices with regard to monitoring third-party provisioning of external data: 
(a) Similar data vetting should be performed as would be the case if the data or service were provided in-house. Data quality checks should be automated (IT/batch processes) when possible, and technical issues as well as reasonableness and consistency should be considered. 
(b) Historical differences in the data provided should trigger inquiries if justified, or if there has been an error. 
(c) Where external data are used, their representativeness, appropriateness and consistency with regard to the institution should be assessed. 
(d) Cross-checks should be carried out between different databases (when available) or between different providers. This is a sign of consistency and robustness. 
(e) SLAs/contract agreements should include the required specific key performance indicators (KPIs) and performance metrics. 
(f) It should be recognised that the data quality of the information provided cannot be determined by its predictive power or by the performance of the model itself."|252
2048|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 150|Other|General topics > 8 Third-party involvement > 8.3 Third-party involvement in internal functions and tasks > 8.3.6 Independent monitoring of third-party performance|"150. The following are considered by the ECB as best practices with regard to monitoring third-party IRB-related tasks: 
(a) the same standards of monitoring and audit should be applied to external tasks as to those performed in-house; 
(b) SLAs/contract agreements should include the specific KPIs and performance metrics that the service should include; 
(c) specific bodies should be designated, with clear responsibilities regarding the monitoring of external IRB activities (such as a monitoring committee)."|132
2049|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 1|Other|Credit risk > 1 Scope of the credit risk chapter|1. The purpose of this chapter is to provide transparency on how the ECB understands a number of topics related to internal models used for the IRB approach, including an initial section covering data maintenance for this approach. It is important to note that this chapter does not aim to cover exhaustively all topics of the CRR for the IRB approach that could be subject to review during internal model investigations. On these selected topics, the chapter is aligned with the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.$^{1}$|114
2050|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 2|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.1 Relevant regulatory references|2. In accordance with Article 144(1) of the CRR, an institution's systems for the management and rating of credit risk exposures must be sound and implemented with integrity. In particular, the institution must collect and store all relevant data to provide effective support to its credit risk measurement and management processes. The ECB understands that, in order to comply with these requirements, institutions should deploy robust, well-documented and adequately tested IT systems, together with sound data management practices.|117
2051|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 3|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.1 Relevant regulatory references|"3. Consequently, this section of the guide sets out the principles regarding the following elements for the management of IRB data:$^{4}$ 
(a) IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing; 
(b) policies, roles and responsibilities in data processing and data quality management; 
(c) components of the data quality management framework."|87
2052|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 4|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.1 Infrastructure|4. Sound and robust IT infrastructures play an essential role in supporting the institution's rating systems. In addition, and in accordance with Article 175(1) of the CRR, institutions must document the design and operational details of their rating systems.|84
2053|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 5|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.1 Infrastructure|5. With regard to the soundness and robustness of institutions' IT infrastructure, the ECB considers that Article 75(2) and (3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439 provides a good understanding of the elements that institutions should take into account in order to comply with the data-related requirements of the CRR.$^{5}$|109
2054|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 6|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.1 Infrastructure|"6. Furthermore, to comply with the documentation requirements for the rating systems as established under Article 144(1)(e) and Article 175(1) of the CRR, it is the ECB's view that institutions should document and keep an updated register of all current and past versions of the following elements of a rating system: 
(a) the model's data 6 flow (from data entry 7 to reporting and for both historical data and current exposure data), identifying the relevant workflows and procedures relating to data extraction, data collection, data storage and data transformations; 
(b) the relevant sources of data and the global map of IT systems and databases involved in the calculation systems used for the purposes of the IRB approach; 
(c) the relevant functional specification of IT systems and databases, including their size, date of construction and data dictionaries, specifying the content of the fields and of the different valid data values that could be inserted in them, with clear definitions of data items; 
(d) the relevant technical specification of IT systems and databases, including the type of database, tables, database management system, database architecture, and data models given in any standard data modelling notation; 
(e) the audit trail for critical IT systems and databases."|283
2055|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 6|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.1 Infrastructure|To allow an independent knowledgeable third party to obtain a detailed outline of the different IT elements of the rating systems, the documentation produced by the institution should be clear and understandable.|66
2056|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 6|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.1 Infrastructure|To comply with the requirement to document its rating system and the rationale for its design, 8 the institution should keep the register of all rating systems, including all current and past versions of rating systems, updated for a period of at least three years and, whenever necessary, an extended period beyond that. This is also reflected in Article 32(1) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439. In any case, the institution should ensure that the elements mentioned in paragraph 6(a) to (e) for the current rating system are adequately recorded in the register and enable a clear understanding of all relevant data of the current rating system that must be stored by the institution.$^{9}$|177
2057|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 7|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.2 IT implementation of a new model or model change|"7. When applying for an initial model approval or for roll-out of the IRB approach, the institution should provide evidence that it has implemented the proposed model into a live 10 or, if duly justified, non-live production environment$^{11}$. In particular, this means that the institution: 
(a) is able to produce risk parameter estimates for exposures in the scope of application; 
(b) has successfully completed IT user acceptance tests; 
(c) is able to calculate under the IRB approach the own funds requirements resulting from its risk parameters estimates; 
(d) is able to submit the respective COREP reporting (Article 144(1)(g) of the CRR); 
(e) is able to use the model for internal risk measurement and management purposes; 
(f) is ready to introduce a reporting system based on the risk parameters produced by the model.$^{12}$"|219
2058|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 8|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.2 IT implementation of a new model or model change|8. When applying for a material model change, the institution should provide evidence that it is able to provide a new version of the relevant IT systems ready to be put into production once the change is approved (i.e. when applying for a material model change, it should also be able to fully replicate the execution of the model and the calculation of own funds requirements according to the model change in a non-live production environment, fulfilling the points set out in paragraphs 7(a) to (f) above). In addition, it should be able to demonstrate that it has set up an appropriate process to ensure that the full IT implementation would be completed successfully with regard to the date of implementation of the changed model, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26 of the general topics chapter.|199
2059|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 9|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.3 Implementation testing|9. In order to ensure the integrity and robustness of IT systems 13 and in particular that, in terms of IT, the implementation of the models is successful and errorfree, institutions should have in place a consistent process for testing the relevant IRB systems and applications upon first implementation and on an ongoing basis. This IT-testing process should be clearly defined and documented in an organisation-wide policy and procedure.|115
2060|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 10|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.3 Implementation testing|10. To achieve its objective the policy should consider all potential events that should trigger a testing procedure and their impact on the tests to be conducted. The trigger events that should be considered include: software releases or material IT-related changes, regulatory changes, model methodology changes and the extension of the range of application of a rating system.|99
2061|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 11|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.3 Implementation testing|"11. IT implementation tests to be considered include the following: 
(a) unit/component/module tests; 
(b) integration tests (of units and between systems); 
(c) system tests (this includes functionality, performance - in normal and stress scenarios - and security and portability tests); 
(d) user acceptance testing (functional testing); 
(e) regression testing."|107
2062|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 12|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.2 IT systems: infrastructure and implementation testing > 2.2.3 Implementation testing|12. In principle, the unit(s) responsible for performing the implementation tests should be clearly identified and the results of the tests should be documented. It is the ECB's view that as a general rule institutions should develop a standardised format for the documentation of test results.|88
2063|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 13|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.3 Policies, roles and responsibilities in data processing and data quality management|13. For institutions to be able to comply with the requirement to collect and store all relevant data established under Article 144(1)(d) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that policies and rules on data management should be defined at group level 14 for both of the following aspects: data processing (i.e. data collection, storage, validation, migration, actualisation and use), and data quality management (see Section 2.4 of this chapter).|127
2064|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 14|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.3 Policies, roles and responsibilities in data processing and data quality management|"14. As for data processing, and in particular with regard to manual interventions and data transfers, the following principles should be considered: 
(a) to ensure that all data transformations are traceable and controlled, general guidelines and rules should be clearly formalised with regard to manual interventions within the data processing; 
(b) to ensure timeliness and accountability, all data transfers should be formally agreed upon (for example by means of service level agreements) by data providers and data users (for both outsourced and in-house processes)."|134
2065|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 15|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.3 Policies, roles and responsibilities in data processing and data quality management|"15. To ensure the integrity of the data processes, the policies and rules on data management should clearly set out the relevant data governance arrangements. It is also expected that these policies and rules will specify the different roles and responsibilities assigned to data management. These include data quality roles and responsibilities for both business owners and IT functions and data and systems ownership throughout the entire credit risk modelling life cycle (including all IT systems used). These policies should take into account the following principles. 
(a) The responsibilities of business owners include: 
(i) ensuring data are correctly entered, kept up to date and aligned with the institution's data definitions; 
(ii) ensuring that data aggregation capabilities and reporting practices are consistent with the institution's policies. 
(b) IT functions are responsible for supporting the operation of the systems for data collection, processing, transformation, storage and availability during the entire life cycle of the data. 
(c) Different business owners and IT systems owners may be appointed throughout the data life cycle. However, each data source, IT system and process step should have an assigned business owner and/or IT systems owner that can be formally identified."|255
2066|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 16|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework|16. Institutions must have in place a process for vetting data inputs into the model. This must include an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data. 15 To comply with this requirement and to ensure the quality of the data used for credit risk measurement and management processes, it is the ECB's view that institutions should establish and implement an effective data quality management framework that is formalised in a set of policies and procedures. This framework should be applicable to all data used in IRB-related processes, i.e. internal data, external data and pooled data, if any. In addition, it should ensure that reliable risk information is available to enable an institution's risk profile to be assessed accurately and drive sound decision-making within the institution and by external stakeholders, including competent authorities.|182
2067|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 17|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework|"17. The ECB considers that the data quality management framework is effective when it encompasses the following components: 
(a) sound underlying governance principles (see Section 2.4.1 of this chapter), particularly those relating to the allocation and fulfilment of roles and responsibilities for the management of data quality in a manner that ensures that data quality management activities are independent of data processing activities; 
(b) a description of the scope in terms of risk data coverage (see Section 2.4.2); 
(c) data quality standards covering all relevant data quality dimensions, i.e. completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, availability and traceability (see Section 2.4.3); 
(d) consistent criteria and a systematic metrics approach to assess compliance with data quality standards; this should be supported by sufficient data quality controls along the entire IRB data chain (see Section 2.4.4); 
(e) procedures for constantly assessing and improving the quality of data (see Section 2.4.5); 
(f) reporting procedures on data quality allowing for sufficient understanding of the quality of the data supporting the IRB models (see Section 2.4.6)."|265
2068|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 17|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework|The following sections further develop the above-mentioned elements.|32
2069|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 18|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.1 Governance principles for the data quality management framework|"18. The data quality management framework: 
(a) should be approved by the institution's management body or a designated committee thereof and senior management as part of their responsibilities; 
(b) should be distributed throughout the organisation to the relevant staff; 
(c) should be regularly assessed in order to verify its adequacy, and be updated and improved whenever necessary; 
(d) should be subject to regular review by the internal audit function or another comparable independent auditing unit.$^{16}$"|132
2070|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 19|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.1 Governance principles for the data quality management framework|19. The roles of the different units, internal bodies and staff involved in the data quality management process should be defined in such a way as to ensure that the data handling process is sufficiently independent of the data quality management process.|82
2071|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 20|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.1 Governance principles for the data quality management framework|20. The ECB considers it best practice for institutions to have a dedicated independent unit with an overall view of and responsibility for the management of data quality. Where an independent unit is established, the size of this unit should be proportionate to the nature, size and degree of complexity of the institution's business and organisational structure.|102
2072|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 21|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.2 Scope of the data quality management framework|"21. The data quality management framework: 
(a) should cover all relevant data quality dimensions: completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, availability and traceability (see paragraph 16); 
(b) should cover the whole data life cycle, from data entry to reporting, and encompass both historical data and current application databases."|105
2073|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 22|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.2 Scope of the data quality management framework|22. If institutions use data provided by third parties, the ECB considers it best practice for them to ensure that the third party has data quality processes in place to ensure the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data provided.$^{17}$|85
2074|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 23|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.3 Data quality standards in the data quality management framework|"23. In accordance with Article 174(b) of the CRR, institutions must implement a process for vetting data inputs into the model which must include an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of data. The ECB understands that, in order to comply with this requirement, institutions should establish data quality standards that set the objectives and overall scope of the data quality management process. To this end, these standards should be defined for the following data quality dimensions 18 for all data inputs into the model and at each stage of the data life cycle: 
(a) completeness (values are present in any attributes that require them); 
(b) accuracy (data are substantively error-free); 
(c) consistency (a given set of data can be matched across the institution's different data sources); 
(d) timeliness (data values are up to date); 
(e) uniqueness (aggregate data are free from any duplication arisi ng from fil ters or other transformations of source data); 
(f) validity (data are founded on an adequate and rigorous classification system that ensures their acceptance); 
(g) availability/accessibility (data are made available to the relevant stakeholders); 
(h) traceability (the history, processing and location of the data under consideration can be easily traced)."|294
2075|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 24|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.4 Data quality controls|24. Data quality should be measured in an integrated and systematic way. The measurement system and the frequency of its application should be formalised.|60
2076|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 25|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.4 Data quality controls|25. Indicators and their corresponding tolerance levels and thresholds should be set in order to monitor compliance with the standards established and should be combined with visual systems (e.g. red/amber/green traffic-light system) and dashboards for monitoring and reporting purposes.|84
2077|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 26|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.4 Data quality controls|26. Indicators should be supported by effective and sufficient data quality checks and controls throughout the data life cycle, from data entry to reporting, and for both historical data and current application data. Data quality checks and controls should include reconciliation across and within systems, including between accounting and IRB data. An effective control framework should therefore be in place to ensure that sound controls and related procedures are implemented, especially for manual processes.|116
2078|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 27|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.5 Remediation of data quality issues|27. A process for the identification and remediation of data quality deficiencies should be in place in order to constantly improve data quality and promote compliance with the data quality standards.|69
2079|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 28|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.5 Remediation of data quality issues|28. Data quality assessments should be carried out independently (see paragraphs 19 and 20) and recommendations should be issued with an indication of their priority, based on the materiality of the incidents identified. All such data quality incidents should be recorded and monitored. For each of the data quality incidents, an owner responsible for resolving the incident should be appointed and an action plan for dealing with the incident drawn up on the basis of the priority assigned. Remediation timelines should depend on the severity and impact of the incident and the implementation timelines required to resolve it. Data quality incidents should be resolved at source level 19 or, if this is not possible, mitigated by taking a prudent approach.|173
2080|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 29|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.6 Data quality reporting|"29. In accordance with Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR, the institution's senior management must ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the ratings systems are working properly. To accomplish this, the ECB understands that a formal reporting process on the quality of risk data should be in place with the objective of improving the quality of data and enabling an assessment of the potential impact of data quality in own fund requirements calculations. In general, this reporting should be presented in a standardised format with clear and concise content, including the following: 
(a) a comprehensive overview of the performance of the model in terms of data quality, including external data and pooled data, if any, at all stages of the IRB life cycle, from data entry to reporting, for both historical data and current exposure data; 
(b) findings and, where applicable, recommendations to address detected weaknesses or shortfalls; 
(c) sufficient and appropriate evidence that the recommendations have been adequately addressed and properly implemented (e.g. by means of a status report)."|241
2081|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 30|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.6 Data quality reporting|30. In accordance with Article 189(1) of the CRR, the management body or a designated committee thereof and senior management must possess a general understanding of the rating systems of the institution and a detailed comprehension of its associated management reports. To comply with this requirement, the ECB understands that reports on the quality of risk data should be submitted to these parties. In addition, the ECB considers it best practice for these reports to also be submitted to all other relevant staff, including modellers, internal validation, internal audit, data quality managers, data owners and other business units involved.|149
2082|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 31|Data requirements|Credit risk > 2 Data maintenance for the IRB approach > 2.4 Data quality management framework > 2.4.6 Data quality reporting|31. Data quality reports should be produced and submitted to senior management more frequently than annually to enable senior management to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating systems are operating properly in accordance with Article 189(2)(c) of the CRR.|84
2083|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 32|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.1 Relevant regulatory references|32. In accordance with Article 144(1)(d) of the CRR, institutions must collect and store all relevant data to provide effective support to their credit risk measurement and management processes. Furthermore, good data quality is a fundamental condition for developing a robust rating system. The ECB considers that, to comply with these requirements and ensure the quality of data, institutions should have sound policies, processes and methods in place, under paragraphs 15 to 34 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD for assessing and improving the quality and representativeness of the data used in the modelling and risk quantification process.|141
2084|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 33|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.1 Relevant regulatory references|33. Since the data-related requirements of the CRR also apply in cases where an institution estimates CCFs, paragraph 32 is also relevant for such institutions.|50
2085|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 34|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.2 Use of external data|34. Data-related requirements established under the CRR apply to all data: internal, external or pooled. In the ECB's understanding, therefore, paragraph 32 is also relevant in the event that an institution uses external or pooled data. The principles on the collection and storage of data are relevant to the institutions' own data and to the data received from the pool.|91
2086|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 35|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.2 Use of external data|35. To ensure that credit risk management and measurement processes are built on appropriate data, for the purposes of risk differentiation, risk quantification and review of estimates institutions should assess whether external data can be used to complement internal data when they consider they do not have sufficient available internal data.|74
2087|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 36|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.2 Use of external data|36. In addition, when institutions use different data sources (including different external databases, whether or not combined with internal data) for the purpose of risk quantification, there could be a risk that the sources include common obligors among the data sources used for risk quantification. This could lead to bias or double-counting effects in the calculation of one-year default rates. To avoid this risk, institutions should develop the necessary processes in order to identify common obligors within these databases and ensure that each common obligor is only taken into account once in the calculation of one-year default rates. 20 When institutions are not able to identify common obligors, they should analyse potential bias or double-counting effects in the calculation of one-year default rates. These bias or double-counting effects should be reflected appropriately in the computation of one-year default rates and long-run average (LRA) default rates.|197
2088|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 37|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.2 Use of external data|37. If an institution uses statistical models and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities grades or pools, the data used to build the model must be representative of the population of the institution's actual obligors or facilities. 21 If external data are used, the same requirements with regard to representativeness 22 must be applicable vis-à-vis the bank's portfolio or portfolio subset for which the external data are used.|106
2089|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 38|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.2 Use of external data|38. Proving representativeness in cases where an institution uses external data is generally more difficult, as internal data are scarce. If an institution cannot provide sufficient proof that the external data are representative, in the ECB's view it may still use external data if it shows (by quantitative analysis and/or qualitative argumentation) that the information gained from the use of the external data outweighs any drawbacks stemming from the deficiencies identified. For this purpose, institutions should provide evidence that the model's performance does not deteriorate when information derived from the external data is included, that the parameter estimates 23 are not biased and that an appropriate margin of conservatism (MoC) is applied. To assess these issues, the institution should conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses specifically designed for this purpose.|172
2090|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 39|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.2 Use of external data|39. In accordance with Article 174(b) of the CRR, if an institution uses statistical models and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities grades or pools, it must have in place a process for vetting data inputs to the model, which should include an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data. In addition, and in accordance with Article 179(1)(a), in quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with rating grades or pools institutions must incorporate all relevant data, information and methods. To comply with these requirements, institutions should ensure that, when external data are used for risk differentiation, risk quantification or review of estimates, they know the data sources and the most relevant data processing operations of the variables acting as direct model inputs performed by the data provider. Institutions should be able to differentiate between internal and external data and to document which information is internal and which information is received from external data sources. To ensure that the data remain appropriate, institutions should provide an adequate rationale in the event that, for the purpose of risk differentiation, risk quantification or review of estimates, they modify the external data acquired, select only part of a wider external database or use different external providers.|266
2091|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 40|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.3 Use of external bureau scores or external ratings as input variables in the rating process|"40. Where an institution uses external credit bureau scores or external ratings as input variables in the rating process, and in particular when externally sourced scores are the main (or one of the main) input variable(s) of the overall internal rating, there is a risk that an internal model may not consider all relevant information. In the ECB's understanding, institutions mitigate this risk when they comply with the following principles. 
(a) The external scores or ratings and/or data are regularly updated or refreshed, especially where credit bureau information is dynamic and is used not only for the application rating but also for the ongoing behavioural rating. 
(b) Institutions understand the structure and nature of external scores or ratings and their key drivers. They also regularly verify that the results of the credit bureau score continue to be appropriate input variables in their credit rating process, for example by reviewing any changes in the credit bureau score methodology. The greater the importance of the external scores or ratings, the greater understanding institutions should demonstrate of their structure, nature and key drivers and the higher the frequency that should be considered in monitoring the appropriateness of these external scores or ratings. 
(c) Validation requirements are similar to those applied to other internal and external input variables. 
(d) Even when the external score or rating is the main (or one of the main) driver(s) of the internal rating, the institution ensures that all relevant internal information regarding the creditworthiness of the obligor is taken into account with sufficient weighting in the internal rating. In addition, the institution demonstrates that the additional relevant internal information considered in the model and its weighting are sufficient to ensure that the internal rating does not merely take on the results of the external bureau scores or the external ratings used. 
(e) When institutions make use of external scores or ratings or any other judgement-based assessment provided by a third party as input variables in the rating process, they should ensure that any potential correlation between the relevant risk drivers does not lead to bias or a doublecounting effect in the risk parameter estimates. This can be especially relevant in these cases, due to the potential use of duplicated information. 
(f) The institution remains responsible for the performance of the model."|466
2092|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 41|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.4 Use of pooled data$^{24}$|41. The use of pooled data is treated similarly to the situation where internal data are combined with data derived from a different (and external) set of obligors or facilities, as mentioned in Section 3.2.|66
2093|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 42|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.4 Use of pooled data$^{24}$|"42. In accordance with Article 179(2)(a) of the CRR, where an institution uses data that are pooled across institutions the rating systems and criteria of other institutions in the pool must be similar to its own. To comply with this requirement an institution should, among other things: 
(a) ensure that there is a common definition of the key drivers and processes; 
(b) ensure that policies and procedures considered for human judgement, including overrides$^{25}$, can be applied in a comparable and similar manner across all participating institutions."|132
2094|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 43|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.5 Use of purchased rating systems or models (pool models$^{26 27}$)|43. In accordance with the last sentence of Article 144(1) of the CRR, the requirements to use an IRB approach, including own estimates and CCFs, apply also where an institution has implemented a rating system, or model used within a rating system, that it has purchased from a third-party vendor. To comply with this provision, institutions should ensure in such cases that all relevant internal information for model development and parameter calibration is taken into account. In particular, LRAs of default rates, LGD and CCFs based only on internal data should always be computed and considered for calibration. The institution remains responsible for the performance of the rating system or model.|168
2095|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 44|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.5 Use of purchased rating systems or models (pool models$^{26 27}$)|"44. In addition, to ensure the integrity of the rating systems or internal models when institutions make use of pool models, and to comply with Article 144(1) of the CRR, the principles set out below should be followed. 
(a) If PD estimates are calculated using pooled data, institutions should verify that the data used for risk quantification meet the data requirements for default rate calculation as clarified in paragraph 121 below, or that the data are adjusted accordingly. 
(b) Where several institutions use a common pool model, each should ensure that its rating process is aligned to the extent that all input risk drivers are defined in the same way across all participating institutions. The institutions should also ensure that all assessments of the qualitative components of the rating model are performed in a comparable manner. 
(c) If a pool model is used for the estimation of risk parameters and the model-relevant parts of the process for managing distressed obligors (including the strategy before and after default) of the participating institutions are not aligned, these differences should be appropriately taken into account within the model or through an appropriate adjustment, in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(viii) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. In the case of a pool model for the estimation of LGD parameters, differences in the model-relevant parts of the workout processes should also be taken into account within the model or through an appropriate adjustment. 
(d) Institutions should ensure that all relevant internal information with respect to the creditworthiness of an obligor is taken into account and the rating is updated with new information in a timely manner. 
(e) Each institution should remain responsible for the performance of the rating model on its own portfolio."|374
2096|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 45|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.5 Use of purchased rating systems or models (pool models$^{26 27}$)|45. To ensure that its ratings systems are operating properly on an ongoing basis, if an institution introduces systematic adjustments to the outputs of the pool model, the institution concerned should initiate internal procedures to analyse whether significant weaknesses in the model exist and whether a model change needs to be triggered.|87
2097|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 46|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.6 Use of human judgement|"46. In accordance with Article 171(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must have specific definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades or pools. The grade and pool definitions must be sufficiently detailed. To comply with this provision, institutions should ensure that, when human judgement is used in the assignment of exposures to grades or pools, there is a framework in place that establishes clear and detailed guidelines and procedures on the application of human judgement (e.g. through the use of pre-defined questionnaires). The use of human judgement should be documented in a way that ensures the rating assignment can be understood and replicated by a third party. 28 To ensure the replicability and consistency of the rating assignment process, the principles set out below should be followed. 
(a) The basic structure of the model 29 should be applied consistently and not modified by human judgement. It should, in particular, consist of: 
(i) the minimum data sources to be used for the grade/pool assignment; 
(ii) the complete list of pre-defined risk drivers which need to be assessed individually and for which the assessments need to be stored; 
(iii) the importance of and the evaluation criteria for the risk drivers, particularly the functional relationship 30 between risk drivers and the assigned rating (before overrides); 
(iv) the procedures and steps to be followed during the assessment, including the steps where overrides can be applied. 
(b) Institutions should assess the consistency of the rating assignment process. To this end, they should define the tests and analyses in a way that is proportionate to the degree of human judgement applied. In cases where human judgement is the main component of the rating assignment process, these tests should at least include an analysis of consistency in a representative sample by having obligors re-rated independently by different analysts. The results of the ratings consistency assessment should be analysed against pre-defined thresholds as part of the framework for review of estimates."|407
2098|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 47|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.6 Use of human judgement|47. In accordance with Article 172(3) of the CRR, for grade and pool assignments institutions must document the situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process and the personnel responsible for approving these overrides. In the context of this requirement, the ECB understands that an override is a judgement-based and discretionary action that contributes to the assessment of the obligor's creditworthiness as obtained through pre-defined components of the rating system. These comprise both automatic/quantitative components 31 and qualitative variables$^{32}$. An override constitutes a direct intervention to an input or to an intermediate 33 or output of the rating assignment process, through an adjustment or replacement of that input or intermediate/final output which is obtained under the regular assignment process. Overrides should be limited to information relevant to the obligor's creditworthiness, if this is not captured well by the predefined components of the model.$^{34}$|207
2099|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 48|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.6 Use of human judgement|48. Within a rating assignment process, the use of pre-defined risk drivers in the form of qualitative model inputs should be distinguished from overrides. These judgement-based or qualitative variables are expected to be considered under the regular assignment process and as part of the pre-defined components of the rating system. Therefore, they are not themselves considered as overrides.$^{35}$|88
2100|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 49|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.6 Use of human judgement|49. Whenever the functional relationship between the risk drivers and the assigned rating as specified in paragraph 46(a)(iii) is circumvented, for example in cases where the last-assigned rating deviates from the rating that would be assigned on the basis of this functional relationship, it is considered to be an override. For the purposes of Article 172(3) of the CRR, it should therefore be specified in the policies and criteria for the use of overrides in the rating assignment process.|117
2101|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 50|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.6 Use of human judgement|50. In accordance with Article 174(e) of the CRR, the results of the statistical model must be complemented by human judgement, especially by taking into account all information not included in the model. The higher the number of relevant observations, the more the institution should rely on the outcomes of the statistical model.|82
2102|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 51|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.6 Use of human judgement|51. In addition, when human judgement is used for the purpose of model development, for example in setting the model's assumptions, the identification of risk drivers and determination of their weights, or the identification and combination of model components, there is a risk of the model-based assignments being inaccurate. 36 To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that the incorporation of human judgement is appropriately managed and proportionate to the number of relevant available observations.|106
2103|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 52|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.6 Use of human judgement|52. For the purposes of quantifying the risk parameters to be associated with grades or pools, estimates must not be based purely on judgemental considerations. 37 To this end, where human judgement is used to a greater extent because of the low number of relevant available observations, institutions should apply a higher MoC to their estimates to account for additional uncertainty.|89
2104|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 53|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.6 Use of human judgement|53. In addition, whenever human judgement is used in the estimation of risk parameters (for either risk differentiation or risk quantification purposes) institutions are expected to have in place a framework under paragraph 35 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.|69
2105|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 54|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.7 Use of data in the case of consolidations|54. Consolidations, i.e. mergers and acquisitions, frequently lead to the acquirer's IRB models being extended to the target's portfolios. In such cases, the ECB understands that the combined default and loss histories of the acquirer and the target should be used to calibrate the IRB models following the extension.$^{38}$|92
2106|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 55|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.7 Use of data in the case of consolidations|55. In particular, for loss data, where the acquiring bank's workout processes are different from those of the acquired bank, the acquiring bank should apply paragraphs 33 and 38 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. However, in line with paragraph 163 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, it is the ECB's understanding that the defaults relating to the acquired bank's portfolio should not be excluded.|110
2107|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 56|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.7 Use of data in the case of consolidations|56. Where the acquirer does not automatically have the legal right to access the default and loss histories of the acquired portfolios (e.g. in the case of a portfolio acquisition), the acquirer should nevertheless make reasonable efforts to acquire these data.|72
2108|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 57|Data requirements|Credit risk > 3 Use of data > 3.7 Use of data in the case of consolidations|57. Where the acquirer has not been able to access the default and loss histories of the acquired portfolios or where the default and loss histories are limited in scope, length or quality, and where the acquirer cannot prove that the inability to access this data does not lead to bias, the acquirer should consider this as a data deficiency and apply an appropriate adjustment and MoC accordingly.|100
2109|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 58|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.1 Relevant regulatory references|58. Article 178(1) of the CRR gives a definition of default to be considered for risk quantification under the IRB approach.|47
2110|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 59|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.1 Relevant regulatory references|"59. According to Article 178(1) and (2)(d) of the CRR in conjunction with Article 3 of the ECB Regulation on discretion on materiality threshold and Article 4 of the ECB Regulation on options and discretions, a default must be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the following have taken place: 
(a) the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions such as realising security (""unlikeness to pay"" criterion); 
(b) the obligor is more than 90 consecutive days past due on any material credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries (""days past due"" criterion), considering that a credit obligation past due is material when it: 
(i) exceeds €100 if it is a retail exposure or €500 if it is an exposure other than retail exposure; and 
(ii) represents more than 1% of the total amount of all on-balance sheet exposures to that obligor for the credit institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries, excluding equity exposures."|266
2111|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 60|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.2 Consistency of the application|60. Where the definition of default is applied at obligor level, both the days past due criterion and the unlikeness to pay criterion must be assessed with regard to all exposures of an obligor to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. This implies that, for a banking group, all information about the different exposures and the behaviour of the obligor across the banking group must be consolidated. This also applies in cases where the definition of default is applied at the level of an individual credit facility for those subsets of indications of unlikeness to pay that are related to the condition of the obligor rather than the status of a particular exposure e.g. bankruptcy status. A certain degree of leeway is granted with regard to the implementation of this groupwide view in identifying defaults, as described in paragraphs 81 and 82 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD.|199
2112|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 61|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.2 Consistency of the application|"61. Paragraph 82 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD acknowledges that mechanisms or procedures for the consistent identification of the default of an obligor need not be applied if it is too burdensome for institutions to verify the status of a client in all legal entities and at all geographical locations within the group. In such a case, institutions may not perform the check for consistency if they can demonstrate that the effect of non-compliance is immaterial because there are no or a very limited number of common clients among the relevant entities within a group and the exposure to these clients is immaterial. With a view to operationalising paragraph 82 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD, the ECB understands that it is best practice for the institution to have a regular process for monitoring common obligors so as to ensure on a regular basis that the conditions set out in paragraph 82 (continue to) apply. As a minimum, it is the ECB's understanding that the following points should be documented in the internal policies of the institution regarding this monitoring process: 
(a) all assumptions made for the purpose of the regular analysis of common obligors should be clearly stated (in particular for the correct identification of common obligors across legal entities or geographies); 
(b) the levels of the thresholds according to which the number of common obligors is deemed very limited and their exposure is deemed immaterial should be clearly stated, justified (at least qualitatively) and reasonable; 
(c) the actions to be taken when the aforementioned thresholds are breached should be clearly described; 
(d) the frequency of the monitoring process should be commensurate with the share of common obligors evaluated in both numbers and exposures, and in all cases should be no less than annual."|368
2113|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 62|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.2 Consistency of the application|62. The materiality thresholds for the purpose of the definition of default applied by an institution outside the SSM area and a parent significant institution may be different, even if both belong to the same banking group, because a materiality threshold which differs from the one set by the ECB may apply under national law outside the SSM area. This scenario is one of those addressed by paragraphs 83 to 85 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD. Without prejudice to the provisions set out in the previous paragraph, if an obligor has exposures under both SSM and non-SSM jurisdictions, institutions should check both the ECB materiality threshold and the materiality threshold (if any) applicable in the other jurisdiction. The default will be triggered in the jurisdiction where the materiality threshold, computed on the basis of consolidated exposures and arrears, is first exceeded for more than 90 consecutive days, and institutions are then expected to apply additional unlikely to pay triggers, making use of the provisions set out in paragraph 58 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD, to achieve a consistent default status across all jurisdictions.|242
2114|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 63|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.2 Consistency of the application|63. Paragraphs 95 to 105 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD clarify the treatment of joint credit obligations when the definition of default is applied at obligor level for retail exposures. In the ECB's understanding, it is best practice for institutions to foster consistency within the process related to the default identification by also applying these requirements to joint credit obligations 44 involving non-retail exposures.|98
2115|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 64|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.2 Consistency of the application|64. Institutions should distinguish the concept of joint credit obligation from the concept of exposure secured by another individual or entity. In the latter case, if the guarantor has to step in to make payments not made by the obligor, then the obligor should be classified as defaulted because it failed to repay the credit obligation without recourse by the institution to the guarantor. Instead, in the case of a joint credit obligation, the joint obligor should be treated as a different obligor from each of the individual obligors, and the fact that one individual obligor pays the joint obligation in full does not lead to the automatic classification of the other individual obligor as defaulted. From a risk quantification perspective, since the joint obligors should be counted as separate obligors, a default on a joint credit obligation should be counted separately from the default of individual obligors in the default time series. Since defaults on joint obligors and related individual obligors will be correlated to some extent, institutions should ensure this does not lead to biased results or wrong conclusions during the development or the validation of the PD model where one-year default rates are computed, particularly if this correlation implies a violation of the assumptions required by the underlying statistical methodologies (e.g. in the validation of model performance) under Article 180(1)(d) of the CRR.|287
2116|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 65|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|65. The days past due criterion applies to all exposures, irrespective of their related repayment scheme and features. If an obligor holds products envisaging small interest payments compared with the outstanding exposures (e.g. bullet loans or interest-only mortgages) and becomes past due, then several missed payments would be needed to exceed the relative component of the materiality threshold and eventually trigger the default according to the past due criterion. Institutions that wish to anticipate the default recognition for this type of product should define appropriate additional indications of unlikeness to pay.|126
2117|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 66|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|"66. When the days past due criterion is met, institutions should classify the exposures to defaulted status without further ado. This means that at the onset of the 91st consecutive day after the materiality threshold is exceede d for the fir st time, the institution should activate the default flag for all affected exposures. Moreover, it is the ECB's understanding that the days past due criterion is driven by the exact number of days in which material past due amounts are present. Therefore, proxies in which defaults are triggered, for example, after three months of missed payments or three missed monthly payments (""months in arrears"" approach) are not considered an appropriate implementation of this criterion."|154
2118|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 67|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|67. The days past due criterion where the definition of default is applied at obligor level may, in some cases, lead to a default being identified despite no individual exposures being more than 90 consecutive days past due. This could happen, for instance, if an obligor repays some material past due exposures, but the number of days past due at obligor level keeps increasing - instead of being reset - because there are other material exposures that are just a few days past due at facility level. In that case, a default should be triggered when the counter at obligor level reaches 90 consecutive days, even if the remaining material exposures could be less than 90 consecutive days past due at facility level. However, in the specific case of factoring arrangements where the purchased receivables are recorded in the balance sheet of the institution, if the counter at obligor level reaches 90 but none of the receivables to the obligor is more than 30 consecutive days past due at facility level, then this should be recognised as a technical past due situation according to paragraph 23(d) of the EBA Guidelines on DoD and the default should not be triggered. In such a case, the counters at obligor and facility levels keep running (unless the obligor repays past due exposures) and default is triggered as soon as one receivable is more than 30 consecutive days past due.|300
2119|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 68|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|68. If the past due amounts cease to be material then the counting of days past due is reset and if the default trigger represented by the days past due criterion was active, it ceases to apply. Past due amounts may cease to be material as a result of repayments from the obligor but also in cases where the obligor has an exposure of up to €50,000 and switches from retail to non-retail classification$^{45}$.|109
2120|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 69|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|69. The absolute component of the materiality threshold set in the ECB Regulation on discretion on materiality threshold is expressed in euro and therefore institutions should convert all the relevant amounts to euro when applying the materiality threshold. For this purpose, significant institutions should convert exposures to euro using the exchange rate quoted every day in order to count the number of days that the threshold is exceeded and determine the exact day when default is triggered.|102
2121|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 70|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|70. Institutions should recognise as a credit obligation past due any amount of principal, interest or fee that has not been paid at the date it was due in line with paragraph 16 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD. Fees in this context include maintenance fees for deposit accounts that remain unpaid because the accounts are empty. Written-off amounts should not be considered in the calculation of the obligor's total and past due exposures when assessing the materiality threshold, but institutions should assess, whenever a write-off occurs, whether this qualifies as an indication of unlikeness to pay according to paragraphs 36 to 40 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD.|150
2122|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 71|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|71. Paragraph 19 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD describes the situation where repayment is subject to a dispute between the obligor and the institution, while paragraph 20 describes the situation of a merger between two obligors. In particular, for disputes, it is up to the institution to decide whether counting is suspended and whether the suspension is followed by an assessment of indications of unlikeness to pay. By contrast, the institution should always verify the presence of indications of unlikeliness to pay in cases where a payment is suspended by law or the obligor exercises a contractual right to suspend the payment as set out in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD.|159
2123|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 72|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|72. In line with paragraph 21 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD, the calculation of the sum of all amounts past due should be performed with a frequency allowing timely identification of default. In any case, where the institution calculates days past due less often than daily, it should ensure that the date of default is identified as the date when the past due criterion has actually been fulfilled. In other words, the calculation of days past due can be performed less often than daily but it should then cover each day from the last calculation performed, in line with paragraph 106 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD. In general, institutions should ensure that the calculations of both days past due and default amounts are up to date whenever they are used to support all relevant processes, including internal and external reporting.|178
2124|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 73|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|73. Paragraph 23 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD specifies the definition and treatment of situations where the recognition of default results from technical issues. According to the EBA Guidelines on DoD, technical past due situations should not be considered as defaults in accordance with Article 178 of the CRR. It is the ECB's understanding that the technical issues referred to in point (a) of the same paragraph also include situations where the bank has approved a moratorium or restructuring for an obligor that is less than 90 days past due on material credit obligations but the resulting suspension or reset of days in the past due counter is applied in the systems with some delay when the counter has already reached 90 days. Moreover, it is the ECB's understanding that moratoria granted on the basis of applicable laws having retroactive effects from a period where the obligor was less than 90 days past due on material credit obligations may also be treated as a technical default where the credit decision approving the moratorium was taken when the days past due counter had already reached 90 consecutive days. Any situation other than those described in paragraph 23 should not be classified as technical defaults. This includes, for instance, issues with payments resulting from errors in the data or systems of the obligor and disputes under paragraph 19 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD. With regard to the latter, it is the ECB's understanding that a general treatment of disputes as technical past due situations, for instance because of the impossibility of suspending the counting of days past due in the systems, would lead to an unwarranted inflation of technical past due situations. An exception may be represented by disputes which fulfil the requirements set out in paragraph 19 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD and that are initiated before the default classification, where the corresponding suspension of the counting of days past due is recorded in the systems after the classification in default due to delays in the formal notification of the dispute. In such situations, it is the ECB's understanding that a treatment as technical default in accordance with paragraph 23(a) of the EBA Guidelines on DoD may be allowed.|448
2125|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 74|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|74. The ECB has the following understanding of the application of the specific treatment set out in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD for exposures to central governments, local authorities and public sector entities. The specific treatment under paragraph 25 should be applied as soon as exposures have been materially past due for more than 90 consecutive days, and not before, but only where all conditions specified in paragraph 25 are met. The specific treatment implies that, in accordance with paragraph 26, these exposures are not treated as being defaulted and, from the time of the application of the specific treatment, those exposures have to be excluded from the calculation of the materiality threshold for all other exposures of the obligor. The exposures that are subject to the specific treatment need to be clearly documented. If, after the application of the specific treatment, the materiality threshold is still exceeded on account of other exposures past due which are not covered by the specific treatment, the obligor in question, and all of its exposures, are immediately regarded as having defaulted.|231
2126|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 75|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|"75. The days past due criterion should be applied to factoring and purchased receivables, taking into consideration the specific provisions set out in paragraphs 27 to 32 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD. Institutions should clearly specify in their policies the types of products offered to customers which are considered as factoring and purchased receivables. It is the ECB's understanding that institutions may align their definitions to the indications of which products are considered to be factoring in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2021/451, where ""trade receivables"" are defined."|136
2127|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 76|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.3 Days past due criterion|76. Paragraph 34 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD sets out the condition under which institutions may add another trigger of unlikeness to pay in order to identify defaults on the basis of a lower materiality threshold than the one considered for the days past due criterion. It is the ECB's understanding that, in this case, institutions should monitor this additional unlikeliness to pay trigger together with the days past due criterion in the same way as described in paragraph 62.|115
2128|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 77|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.4 Unlikeness to pay criterion|77. For the purposes of determining unlikeliness to pay in connection with the sale of credit obligations (Article 178(3)(c) of the CRR), according to paragraphs 42 and 43 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD, institutions should analyse the reasons for the sale of credit obligations and the reasons for any losses recognised thereby. If, based on this analysis, the sale is recognised as credit-related, the institution should calculate the materiality of the loss according to the formula set out in paragraph 44 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD to verify whether a default is triggered. When applying the formula, the sale price should be used without any type of adjustment. It should be noted that sales of credit obligations in the context of traditional securitisations where there is a significant risk transfer according to Article 244 of the CRR and the EBA Guidelines on SRT are also considered sales of credit obligations for the purposes of this unlikeliness to pay criterion.|221
2129|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 78|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.4 Unlikeness to pay criterion|"78. [For the purposes of determining unlikeliness to pay in connection with a distressed restructuring (Article 178(3)(d) of the CRR),] in the formula defining the diminished financial obligation set out in paragraph 51 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD, NPV0 and NPV1 are the net present value of the expected cash flows, discounted using the customer's original effective interest rate based on the old and the new arrangements respectively. Cash flows in this context are all payments the obligor is legally bound to perform under the contractual terms. Therefore, NPV0 and NPV1 should not reflect any expected loss due to default or prepayment. Any approximation of the original effective interest rate or treatment of variable rates that is used for accounting purposes should also be used in the calculation of NPV0 and NPV1 for the purpose of default identification. Where the obligor has accumulated late fees or interest rate penalties before the restructuring, the ECB's understanding is as follows. 
(a) If late fees and interest rate penalties that originated from a violation of the original schedule of payments were forgiven, they should not be included in the NPV1 calculation since they are not part of the new contractual schedule of payments. 
(b) If late fees and interest rate penalties rates that originated from a violation of the original schedule of payments were not forgiven, they are consequently included in the obligor's new schedule of payments following the distressed restructuring (possibly with a postponement), and the respective amounts should therefore be included in the NPV1 calculation. This also holds when the institution applies (generic) fees and higher rates in the obligor's new schedule of payments as part of the distressed restructuring. 
(c) Late fees and interest rate penalties should not in any case be included in the NPV0 calculation as they were not explicitly included in the original contractual schedule of payments. 
(d) The NPV1 calculation assumes that payments duly respect the new schedule. Therefore, fees and penalties that would be triggered in case of violations of the (new) schedule should not be considered in NPV1."|447
2130|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 78|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.4 Unlikeness to pay criterion|In addition, it is the ECB's understanding that the calculation of the diminished financial obligation should only take into consideration expected cash flows. Cash flows having occurred in the past, for example the financed amount and past payments from the obligor, are not expected and should therefore not be considered.|77
2131|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 79|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.4 Unlikeness to pay criterion|79. The calculation of the diminished financial obligation should be performed for all distressed restructurings in accordance with paragraph 52 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD when the distressed restructuring is agreed. Hence, the calculation should also be performed in cases where the threshold is blatantly exceeded, for example if a large part of the principal is forgiven. In this regard, it should be noted that - for institutions using own LGD estimates - the calculated diminished financial obligation is also relevant for deriving the economic loss caused by a default whenever institutions open new facilities to replace previously defaulted facilities as part of a restructuring or for technical reasons (see paragraph 153(b) of this chapter), and the amount by which the financial obligation has diminished is included among the information that the reference dataset for LGD estimation should contain (see paragraph 109(c) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD). If an institution applies a material change to its definition of default by reviewing the threshold for assessing the materiality of the diminished financial obligation, for the purpose of default detection processes the reviewed threshold should be applied to distressed restructurings that occur after the modification of the threshold and does not affect previous restructurings.|262
2132|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 80|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.4 Unlikeness to pay criterion|"80. When applying paragraph 54 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD, which requires that any concession extended to an obligor already in default should lead to the obligor being classified as a distressed restructuring, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should understand the term ""concession"" in the same sense as in Article 47b(1) of the CRR."|97
2133|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 81|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.4 Unlikeness to pay criterion|81. When specifying in their internal policies and procedures other additional indications of unlikeliness to pay of an obligor, institutions should, in line with paragraph 58 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD, define and document additional indications of unlikeness to pay that are appropriate for the specific type of exposure. It is the ECB's understanding that considering only the indications of unlikeness to pay set out in points (a) to (f) of Article 178(3) of the CRR is in principle not deemed an appropriate and prudent approach. In order to define these additional indications, institutions may consider the list provided in paragraph 59 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD.|163
2134|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 82|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.4 Unlikeness to pay criterion|82. In line with paragraph 60 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD, institutions are expected to take into account external information, if available, in their default identification process. In doing so, institutions are free to determine the frequency of the update and monitoring of the external information, possibly differentiating among individual subsets of obligors, provided that the frequency determined for each subset eventually guarantees the timely identification of default.|104
2135|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 83|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.5 Return to non-defaulted status|"83. Paragraphs 72 to 73 and 71 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD provide the minimum conditions for reclassification to non-defaulted status for exposures subject to distressed restructurings and for all other exposures respectively. In particular, for exposures subject to distressed restructurings the minimum probation period 46 is generally longer than for exposures not subject to distressed restructuring. This implies the following. 
(a) If the definition of default is applied at obligor level, institutions should monitor the conditions for reclassification to non-defaulted status that are applicable to each exposure of the obligor, and the obligor may return to non-defaulted status only when all exposures meet their respective conditions. 
(b) If the definition of default is applied at facility level, institutions should monitor the conditions for reclassification to non-defaulted status that are applicable to the facility, and when these are met then the facility may return to non-defaulted status. This means that different defaulted facilities belonging to the same obligor may possibly return to non-defaulted status at different moments in time. However, institutions may make use of the possibility of setting longer probation periods (as set out in paragraphs 71 and 72 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD) to ultimately align these moments."|278
2136|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 84|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.5 Return to non-defaulted status|84. In the case of exposures subject to distressed restructuring, one of the minimum conditions for the reclassification to non-defaulted status is that during the probation period a material payment has been made by the obligor. In this regard, paragraph 73(a) of the EBA Guidelines on DoD provides examples of material payments that should not be construed as mandatory conditions; institutions may define material payments otherwise. It is the ECB's understanding that the appropriateness of such a definition is one of the elements that institutions should consider when monitoring the effectiveness of the policy for the return to non-default status as described in paragraphs 76 to 78 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD.|157
2137|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 85|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.5 Return to non-defaulted status|"85. Minimum conditions for returning to non-defaulted status with regard to past due amounts are different for exposures subject to distressed restructurings. These conditions are as follows. 
(a) Where distressed restructuring does not apply to a defaulted exposure, if all other conditions described in paragraph 71 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD are met, a defaulted exposure can be reclassified to non-defaulted status even if there are still past due amounts that are either not material or material but are less than 90 consecutive days past due. 
(b) Where distressed restructuring applies to a defaulted exposure, under paragraph 73 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD there should be no past due credit obligations according to the schedule applicable after the restructuring arrangements. Hence, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should refrain from allowing the return to non-default status as long as exposures are subject to outstanding past due amounts, even if these past due amounts are immaterial or are material and less than 90 days past due. This condition ensures alignment between defaulted exposures subject to distressed restructuring and forborne non-performing exposures (as also required by paragraphs 54 and 107 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD)."|260
2138|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 86|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.5 Return to non-defaulted status|"86. The activation of new default triggers for already defaulted exposures has a different impact on the probation period depending on whether the exposure is subject to distressed restructuring or not. This is explained as follows. 
(a) Where distressed restructuring does not apply to a defaulted exposure, the probation period should last a minimum of three months from the moment that all default triggers cease to apply. According to the ECB's understanding, this means that if a new default trigger becomes applicable while the probation period is running, then the probation period is reset to zero and will start again when all default triggers, including the new one, will again cease to apply. 
(b) Where distressed restructuring applies to a defaulted exposure, the probation period should last a minimum of one year from the latest of the events specified in paragraph 72 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD and should be reset in the circumstances described in EBA Q&A 2022_6527$^{47}$. According to the ECB's understanding, in general, whenever a new default trigger becomes applicable while the probation period is running, then the probation period is reset to zero and immediately starts again."|248
2139|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 87|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.6 Consistency of external data|"87. In accordance with Article 178(4) of the CRR, institutions that, for the purpose of risk quantification, use external data that are not themselves consistent with the definition of default laid down in paragraph 1 of the same article must make appropriate adjustments to achieve broad equivalence. To comply with this requirement, institutions should ensure that when they make use of external data or pooled data they have a complete understanding of the definition of default applied to these data and demonstrate representativeness of data collected under a different definition of default in the same way as specified for external data in Chapter 6 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD. In this context it is the ECB's understanding that the following applies. 
(a) Where an institution demonstrates that the difference in definitions of default is negligible in terms of the impact on all risk parameters and own funds requirements in general, data based on a definition of default different from the one that is used internally for default identification may continue to be used in the risk quantification RDS without any adjustment. 
(b) Otherwise, institutions should perform appropriate adjustments to (i) the granular data used for risk quantification (as per paragraph 30 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD in conjunction with paragraph 68(b) of the EBA Guidelines on DoD) and/or (ii) aggregated metrics, model components or the risk estimates (as per paragraphs 34, 36, 37 and 38 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD)."|324
2140|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 87|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.6 Consistency of external data|In addition, it is the ECB's understanding that, all other things being equal, the use of external data for the purpose of risk quantification results in a higher level of estimation uncertainty than when using data collected under the definition of default that is used internally for default identification for the relevant type of exposure. Therefore, it would be in line with best practice for institutions to apply a category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(viii) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD when using external data for the purpose of risk quantification.|131
2141|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 88|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.6 Consistency of external data|88. For the purposes of model development, an RDS based on a definition of default different from the internal one may be acceptable under the conditions set out in paragraph 23 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD and as long as institutions provide reasonable assurance that the use of a different definition of default does not have a negative impact on the structure and performance of the rating model in terms of risk differentiation and predictive power with respect to the internal definition of default.|113
2142|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 89|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.7 Adjustments to risk estimates in the case of changes to the definition of default|89. A change to the definition of default should be understood as any change to any aspect of the definition of default set out in Article 178 of the CRR, namely changes to the counting of days past due, changes to the indications of unlikeness to pay or changes to the criteria for allowing the return to nondefaulted status of previously defaulted exposures.|103
2143|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 90|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.7 Adjustments to risk estimates in the case of changes to the definition of default|90. Under the IRB approach, changes to the definition of default require prior approval from the competent authority before they can be implemented. 48 As a consequence, to avoid temporary mismatches in the definitions of default applied under the different approaches, it is advisable that institutions align the implementation timelines of changes for exposures under IRB and under SA so that changes are implemented for all exposures under IRB and under SA after the supervisory approval is granted for exposures treated under the IRB approach.|127
2144|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 91|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.7 Adjustments to risk estimates in the case of changes to the definition of default|91. Where a change has been made to the definition of default, institutions should demonstrate the model's risk differentiation on a time series of realised default rates (or a time series of realised LGD or realised CCF) reflecting the new definition of default. Where institutions determine that their PD (or their LGD or CCF) models do not maintain good risk differentiation capacities with respect to the new definition of default, it is the ECB's understanding that a recalibration is not sufficient to adjust the models to the new definition of default and, in addition to the recalibration, institutions should redevelop 49 their models to the extent needed.|157
2145|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 92|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.7 Adjustments to risk estimates in the case of changes to the definition of default|92. According to paragraph 11(b) of the EBA Guidelines on DoD and paragraph 30 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, where a change has been made to the definition of default, institutions should compare the new definition of default resulting from the change with the definitions underlying the observations included in the RDS used for risk quantification and assess the representativeness of such historical data in the same way as specified for external data in paragraph 87 of this chapter. It is the ECB's understanding that one prerequisite for such a comparison is the construction of an appropriate dataset reflecting the new definition of default. Generally, to assemble a reliable dataset reflecting the new definition of default before changing their definition of default, institutions can adjust historical granular data collected on the basis of the old definition of default in order to achieve broad equivalence to the new definition of default by means of a parallel run (i.e. the implementation of the new definition of default in a parallel environment to the productive systems), a retrospective simulation (i.e. applying the new definition of default retrospectively to historical data) or a similar classification of data according to the new definition of default. Where the adjustments in granular data do not cover the entire historical observation period of the model, institutions may complement the missing periods by using simplifying assumptions such as applying correction factors to aggregated metrics, model components or risk estimates, provided that these assumptions are based on an RDS that covers at least two years of data adjusted at granular level by means of a retrospective simulation, parallel run or similar classification of data according to the new definition of default.|354
2146|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 93|Definition of Default|Credit risk > 4 Definition of default > 4.7 Adjustments to risk estimates in the case of changes to the definition of default|93. According to paragraphs 11(c) and 70 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD, where a change has been made to the definition of default, institutions should add a definition of default-related MoC that is appropriate and sufficient to cover the uncertainty caused by deficiencies in the RDS used for risk quantification owing to the impossibility of performing appropriate adjustments, as well as by uncertainties related to the quantification of appropriate adjustments (at granular or aggregate level) to account for the change in the definition of default in the model's risk quantification. Generally, it is the ECB's understanding that estimation uncertainty also increases in the infrequent cases where institutions do not apply appropriate adjustments to account for the change in the definition of default because they estimate that the impact of the new definition of default on all risk parameters and own funds requirements is negligible. As a consequence, in these situations too, institutions should apply a definition of default-related MoC$^{50}$.|224
2147|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 94|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.1 Relevant regulatory references|"94. In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, estimates must be based on the material drivers of the risk parameters. 51 The relevant material risk drivers and rating criteria may be taken into consideration in several ways: 
(a) when assigning exposures to different PD models; 
(b) at a PD model level when assigning exposures to different ranking/scoring methods; 
(c) as explanatory variables in ranking/scoring methods; 
(d) as drivers when defining calibration segments by splitting exposures covered by the same PD model into subsets carrying a significantly different level of risk; 
(e) as drivers in the process for the assignment of facilities or obligors to grades or pools other than calibration segments."|172
2148|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 95|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.1 Relevant regulatory references|95. When choosing the risk drivers for the models, there is a risk that those drivers that capture the characteristics of defaulted obligors might be inappropriately understood as relevant risk drivers for the portfolio, or that an inappropriate weight might be given to some of them. To mitigate this risk, institutions should take appropriate measures against model misspecification with regard to overfitting. This is particularly relevant where default data for the development of the model are scarce. Where an institution relies on one or more statistical models to define the process of assigning exposures to grades or pools (or parts of this process) in accordance with Article 175(4)(b) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that for institutions to comply with the requirement, set out in Article 144(1)(a) of the CRR, that rating systems should provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk as further explained in letters (c) and (e) of Article 30(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439, the statistical process followed by the institution in selecting its model(s) should include assessing the performance of the model(s) on the basis of independent datasets (data points which were left out of the model fitting) in a way that limits the risk of overfitting. Independent datasets should correspond not only to random sampling (out-of-sample), but also to different time periods (out-of-time) unless there are no sufficient data available for the training sample. The expectations set out above in this paragraph are specifically related to the model development phase. Once the process for assigning exposures to grades or pools has been defined, the requirements related to the framework for the review of estimates under paragraphs 217 to 221 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD apply together with the expectations set out in Section 9 of this chapter. In particular, in accordance with paragraph 218(b)(i) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the institution must carry out an analysis to identify any potential deterioration in the model's performance, including the model's discriminatory power, by comparing its performance at the time of the development with its performance over each subsequent observation period.|472
2149|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 96|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.1 Relevant regulatory references|"96. In accordance with Article 144(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions' rating systems must provide for a meaningful assessment of obligor and transaction characteristics, a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that PD models should perform adequately on economically significant and material sub-ranges of application. 52 The sub-ranges are identified by splitting the full range of application of the PD model into different parts on the basis of potential drivers for risk differentiation, including the following non-exhaustive list of drivers, 53 where relevant: 
(a) for PD models covering exposures to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): country, industry (e.g. statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (abbreviated as NACE$^{54}$) code section classification A to U), size of obligor (e.g. different buckets in terms of total assets), past delinquency (e.g. obligors with delinquency events, i.e. days past due, in the last 12 months); 
(b) for PD models covering retail exposures: client type (e.g. high net worth/private banking, other individuals, self-employed, SMEs), product type (e.g. consumer credit, credit card, other), region (e.g. nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) 1, 2 or 3 as defined by Eurostat), past delinquency (e.g. obligors with delinquency events, i.e. days past due, in the last 12 months), maturity (e.g. original or remaining maturity); 
(c) for PD models covering retail exposures secured by real estate: region (e.g. NUTS 1, 2 or 3 as defined by Eurostat), type of real estate (e.g. residential, commercial, other), past delinquency (e.g. obligors with delinquency events, i.e. days past due, in the last 12 months), maturity (e.g. original or remaining maturity); 
(d) for PD models covering exposures to financial institutions: business model (deposit-taking institutions, investment banking, insurance firms, other), jurisdiction (or global region as appropriate) and size (defined buckets of total assets); 
(e) for PD models covering exposures to large corporates: industry (e.g. NACE code section classification A to U), country (or global region as appropriate) and size (defined buckets of total turnover)."|548

In accordance with Article 169(1) of the CRR, where an institution uses multiple rating systems, the rationale for assigning an obligor or a transaction to a rating system must be documented and applied in a manner that appropriately reflects the level of risk. To comply with this requirement institutions should, in terms of the range of application of a PD model: 
(a) clearly describe its range of application (and sub-divisions into different ranking/scoring methods and calibration segments) and also include an explanation of the risk drivers which the institution considered when designing the process but has decided not to use for the assignment of the obligor to the rating system; 
(b) ensure that there are no overlaps in the range of application of different PD models and that each obligor or facility to which the IRB approach should be applied can be clearly assigned to one particular PD model."|205

Article 170 of the CRR lays down requirements related to the structure of rating systems. To comply with these requirements and with reference to Articles 34 to 36 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439, institutions should, among other things, ensure a meaningful differentiation of risk over time which takes into account (i) the distribution of obligors or facilities; (ii) the homogeneity of obligors or facilities assigned to the same grade or pool; and (iii) the different levels of risk across obligors or facilities assigned to different grades or pools to which a different PD is applied.|155

To ensure that the PD model performs adequately in terms of risk differentiation, institutions should adopt the following approach. 
(a) Define metrics (considering both their evolution over time and specific reference dates) with well-specified targets, taking into account tolerance levels that reflect the uncertainty of the metrics, and take action, where necessary, to rectify any deviations from these targets that exceed the tolerance levels. Separate targets and tolerances may be defined for initial development and ongoing performance. 
(b) Ensure that the tools used to assess risk differentiation are sound and adequate considering the available data. The risk differentiation is expected to be demonstrated on time series of realised default rates for grades or pools under different economic conditions."|168

To comply with this requirement, institutions should: 
(a) justify the criteria applied when determining the number of grades or pools and the proportion of obligors or facilities assigned to each; 
(b) ensure that the concentration of numbers of obligors or facilities is not excessive in any grade or pool; any significant concentrations should be supported by convincing empirical evidence of the homogeneity of risk for those obligors or facilities;

To comply with the requirement to ensure adequate risk differentiation across grades or pools, 55 institutions should ensure that there are no significant overlaps in the distribution of the default risk between grades or pools. This should be ensured through a meaningful differentiation of the default rates of each grade. In particular, the ECB expects that a very granular rating scale$^{56}$ will only be used in cases where the institution is able to empirically confirm the risk differentiation across grades as described in this paragraph.|126

In order to ensure a meaningful assessment of obligor characteristics, 57 when assigning obligors or facilities to a grade or pool institutions should follow paragraphs 66 to 68 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. Although the time horizon used in PD estimation is one year, it is the ECB's understanding that the rating/grade/pool assignment process should also adequately anticipate and reflect risk over a longer time horizon and take into account plausible changes in economic conditions. In order to achieve this objective: 
(a) all relevant information should be included in the rating/grade/pool assignment process, giving an appropriate balance between drivers that are predictive only over a short time horizon and drivers that are predictive over a longer time horizon; 
(b) a horizon of two to three years is considered to be appropriate for most portfolios; 
(c) in accounting for plausible changes in economic conditions, the institution should consider at least past observed default patterns; 
(d) the model should perform under different economic conditions."|230
2165|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 105|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.3 Grade assignment dynamics|As a consequence of the above, institutions' grade assignment dynamics should also adequately anticipate and reflect in the assignment of grades the risk over the longer time horizon. For clarity, this does not mean that grades remain stable over the longer time horizon in the event of changes in the risks that are specific to the obligor.|90
2166|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 106|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.3 Grade assignment dynamics|"106. Additionally, the following principles apply under the specific situations considered in (a) to (c) below: 
(a) when using external scores or ratings (e.g. from an external bureau or external rating agency) as drivers for the purpose of risk differentiation within a specific model, institutions should identify the grade assignment dynamics embedded in the external rating and understand the effect on their own grade assignment dynamics, considering the other risk drivers used; 
(b) when using external ratings as target variables for the purpose of risk differentiation within a specific model (see Section 5.1.5), institutions should preserve their own grade assignment dynamics by taking the appropriate measures when necessary; 
(c) when mapping internal grades to external grades in order to use external default rates to estimate PD, institutions should ensure that the grade assignment dynamics of the external ratings are sufficiently similar to their own internal grade assignment dynamics, or perform the necessary adjustments during risk quantification to compensate for any differences."|221
2167|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 107|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.4 Use of ratings of third parties|"107. In accordance with Article 172(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must assign each obligor to a grade or pool as part of the credit approval process. To comply with this requirement, in accordance with paragraph 62 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should have clear policies specifying the conditions under which the rating of a third party which has a contractual or organisational relationship with an obligor of the institution (third-party support) may be taken into account in the risk assessment of that obligor. These policies should meet the following criteria. 
(a) They should specify in which situations the rating of a parent entity could be taken into account in the risk assessment of other entities of the group. In particular, the policies should specify those situations in which obligors are assigned to a better grade than their parent entities. 
(b) They should include provisions on the use of ratings of third parties that provide contractual support to more than one obligor. As a general rule, the policies should include, but not be limited to, possible prioritisation, eligibility, and the impact on the rating of the supporting third party."|264
2168|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 108|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.4 Use of ratings of third parties|"108. It is the ECB's understanding that a ""rating transfer"" within the meaning of paragraph 62(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD constitutes a mechanism that is distinct from the substitution effect referred to in Article 236 of the CRR. In addition, according to the ECB's interpretation, an ""appropriate guarantee"" within the meaning of paragraph 62(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD should not be understood as credit risk mitigation within the meaning of Article 4(1)(57) of the CRR, but as a contractual agreement between the institution's obligor and the third party, fully covering the obligor by providing the obligor with a claim against the third party that is effective (i.e. it prevents the default) and enforceable (from a legal perspective) before the institution has to recognise a default event of the obligor. When, under paragraph 62(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, an institution performs a rating transfer across different rating systems that do not share the same obligor rating scale, it should ensure that the mapping between rating scales is performed in such a way that the PD estimate (including MoC) assigned to the guaranteed exposure amount is not better than the PD estimate (including MoC) being transferred from a third party. Article 171(2) of the CRR establishes that information used to assign obligors and facilities to grades or pools must be current. To comply with this requirement, if a material proportion of exposures or obligors within a rating system receives a rating from an approved IRB rating system as a result of rating transfers, institutions should ensure that the transferred ratings are automatically updated when the rating of the third party changes or when the PDs of the rating system to which the third party belongs are re-estimated."|403
2169|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 109|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.4 Use of ratings of third parties|109. In the situation described in paragraph 62(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, where a rating of a third party is being taken into account as an indication for an override of the assignment of the relevant obligor to a grade or pool, institutions should not assign a PD estimate (including MoC) to an obligor that is better than the PD estimate (including MoC) of the third party as a consequence of an override resulting solely from the existence of this third-party support. Furthermore, when third-party support is used extensively in the scope of application of a PD model as an indication for an override, institutions should consider its existence as a potential relevant driver for risk differentiation, in accordance with Section 5.1.2 of this chapter.|188
2170|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 110|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.4 Use of ratings of third parties|110. The ECB understands paragraph 62(c) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD to be applicable not only in the presence of contractual support, but also in instances where there is an organisational relationship between the third party and the obligor. In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, estimates must be plausible and intuitive and must be based on the material drivers of the respective risk parameters. To comply with this requirement when the treatment specified in paragraph 62(c) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD is used, institutions should have sufficient empirical evidence to justify situations where an obligor has an equal or better PD estimate (including MoC) than the third party providing support.|179

In addition, differences between the various forms of contractual support should be considered in the PD models unless there is sufficient empirical evidence that these differences are not relevant risk drivers. This understanding should also be taken into account if the rating of the third party is being considered as an indication for an override under paragraph 62(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.|107
2172|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 112|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.4 Use of ratings of third parties|112. Articles 201 to 203 of the CRR establish requirements for the eligibility of unfunded credit protection. To comply with these requirements, institutions may recognise the guarantee by applying the risk weight of the guarantor under the standardised approach to the covered part of the exposure, provided that no own estimates of LGD and CCFs are used (foundation IRB (F-IRB)). This applies when an obligor is guaranteed by a third party that is not in the range of application of a PD model and the guarantee fulfils all requirements for credit risk mitigation (CRM), consistently with paragraph 44 of the EBA Report on the CRM Framework. In such situations, under paragraph 74 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the guaranteed obligor should be included in the calculation of the one-year default rate of the grade the obligor is assigned to, before the recognition of the guarantee.|217
2173|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 113|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.4 Use of ratings of third parties|113. In addition, when the institution reflects substitution effects 58 arising from CRM in the ratings assigned to a material number of exposures within a rating system, there is a risk that the process of assigning exposures to grades or pools might not provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk, as a result of the inclusion of obligors with significantly different risk levels within the same rating grade. 59 To mitigate this risk, institutions should verify that obligors guaranteed by a third party do not carry a significantly different level of risk from those in the same rating grade without such a guarantee, and that no separate calibration segment as referred to in paragraph 97 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD is required.|171
2174|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 114|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.5 Use of shadow rating models|114. The ECB understands a shadow rating model (SRM) to be an internal rating approach that selects and weighs the risk drivers to be used for risk differentiation purposes by identifying the main factors that explain external ratings provided by an external credit assessment institution or similar organisation, rather than internal directly observed defaults.|90
2175|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 115|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.5 Use of shadow rating models|115. In accordance with Article 144(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions must document the rationale for their rating systems. To comply with this requirement, institutions should justify and document the rationale for the use (and the continued use) of the SRM, instead of the internal default prediction model, and also document the alternative approaches that have been considered, in accordance with Article 38 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439. In addition, and without prejudice to the risk differentiation requirements, when developing the model institutions should set explicit threshold criteria in terms of capacity to explain the target ratings and take appropriate action when those thresholds are not met.|168
2176|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 116|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.5 Use of shadow rating models|116. Assignment criteria and processes must be periodically reviewed to determine whether they remain appropriate for the current portfolio and external conditions. 60 To comply with this requirement, as part of the review of estimates institutions should take all reasonable steps to demonstrate how the model performs on the application population in terms of predicting defaults or, if that is not possible (when there are not enough internal default data), at least in terms of predicting the target ratings.|117
2177|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 117|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.5 Use of shadow rating models|117. In accordance with Article 170(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions' rating systems must have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively the quantification of the risk of obligor default. To this end, institutions should adjust the ratings used as targets for their SRMs if they do not solely embed default risk. They should also document such adjustments.|105
2178|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 118|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.5 Use of shadow rating models|118. In accordance with Article 174(1)(a) of the CRR, when an institution uses a statistical model and other mechanical methods to assign exposures to obligors or facilities, the input variables must form a reasonable and effective basis for the resulting predictions. To comply with this requirement, when the institution uses an SRM external ratings should not be used as risk drivers in addition to target variables.|111
2179|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 119|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.5 Use of shadow rating models|119. When assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools institutions must take all relevant information into account. 61 To comply with this requirement, when different information sources are used institutions should ensure that they understand the impact of any differences between these sources and establish adequate procedures to ensure that these differences are adequately addressed.|92
2180|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 120|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.1 Structure of PD models > 5.1.5 Use of shadow rating models|120. Furthermore, the data used to build the model must be representative of the population of the institution's actual obligors or exposures. 62 To comply with this requirement, institutions should analyse and provide evidence of the representativeness of the data used for model development consistently with paragraphs 20 to 27 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.|102
2181|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 121|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|121. In accordance with Article 180(1) of the CRR, for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks and for equity exposures, institutions must estimate PDs by obligor grade from the LRA of one-year default rates. In accordance with Article 180(2) of the CRR, for retail exposures, institutions must estimate PDs by obligor/facility grade or pool from LRAs of one-year default rates. To comply with these requirements, institutions should follow Sections 5.2.2 to 5.2.6 below.|147
2182|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 122|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.2 Calculation of the one-year default rate and observed average default rates|"122. For the calculation of the one-year default rate and observed average default rates, institutions should follow paragraphs 73 to 81 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, also considering the following. 
(a) It is the ECB's understanding that, for retail exposures and when the definition of default is applied at facility level, paragraphs 73 to 81 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD can be applied at facility level. 
(b) It is the ECB's understanding that, whenever the definition of default is applied at obligor level, a joint obligor 63 should be considered as a separate obligor and the default on a joint credit obligation should be counted separately from the default of individual obligors. Consequently, a specific rating/PD should be assigned to the joint obligor and should be counted separately for the default rate and RWA calculation. 
(c) Exposures for which there is no commitment (considering on-balance sheet exposures, off-balance sheet items and unadvised limits) at reference date should be excluded from the calculation of the default rate. Conversely, if there is an EAD estimate, then these exposures should be included in the calculation of the default rate. 
(d) To calculate the one-year default rate in accordance with paragraph 73 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, it is the ECB's understanding that each obligor - or each facility in cases where point (a) above applies existing and not defaulted at the beginning of the one-year observation period should be counted as one in the denominator and, if relevant, in the numerator of the one-year default rate calculation, even where the obligor - or the facility in cases where point (a) above applies - cannot be observed for the entire one-year observation period. 
(e) It is the ECB's understanding that obligors - or facilities in cases where point (a) above applies - that cease to exist (for example because the relevant credit contractual relationship was terminated) during the oneyear observation period should be included in the calculation of the oneyear default rate without any adjustment or deviation from the method as described in point (d) above. This is without prejudice to appropriate adjustments and/or MoC following any identification of deficiencies in data representativeness as described in paragraphs 28 to 33 of the EBA"|511
2183|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 122|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.2 Calculation of the one-year default rate and observed average default rates|"Guidelines on PD and LGD and in line with paragraph 34 and Section 4.4 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. 
(f) Under paragraph 76 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should analyse whether (i) the migrations to a different rating grade, pool or rating model, rating system or approach to calculation of capital requirements within the observation period, or (ii) sales of credit obligations during the observation period bias the default rate. To this end, institutions should do both of the following. 
(i) Ensure that obligors - or facilities in cases where point (a) above applies - are tracked after their migration to a different rating grade, pool, rating model, rating system or approach to calculation of capital requirements, and that any default identified during the one-year observation period, even if after the migration, is duly counted for the one-year default rate calculation. In the ECB's understanding, the lack of such tracking is a data deficiency in the risk quantification that institutions need to address in line with paragraphs 36 to 52 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. 
(ii) Analyse whether sales of credit obligations that occurred during the one-year observation period materially deviate from those that occurred for this portfolio during other observation periods of the dataset used for risk quantification. In the ECB's understanding, the occurrence of such sales of credit obligations during the one-year observation period is a source of increased uncertainty in the risk quantification that institutions need to address in line with paragraphs 36 to 52 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD."|364
2184|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 123|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.2 Calculation of the one-year default rate and observed average default rates|123. For clarity, the above-mentioned requirements for the calculation of one-year default rates also apply in case of external data for PD quantification being used at a more aggregated level than obligor or facility level. Where aggregated external data of a rating agency or similar organisation are used, institutions must ensure that the default rate calculation is aligned to the applicable regulations.|109
2185|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 124|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.2 Calculation of the one-year default rate and observed average default rates|"124. For the purpose of choosing an appropriate approach under paragraph 80 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, it is the ECB's understanding that overlapping one-year time windows should preferably be used when the analysis performed by the institution under paragraphs 80(a), 80(b) and/or 80(d) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD reveals the observed average default rate using overlapping one-year time windows is significantly different from the observed average default rate using non-overlapping one-year time windows and either of the following: 
(a) the proportion of short-term and terminated contracts and/or the respective distribution of default rates is not stable over time; 
(b) there is a significant variation between the observed average default rates calculated using non-overlapping one-year time windows on different reference calculation dates within a year."|203
2186|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 125|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.2 Calculation of the one-year default rate and observed average default rates|125. Institutions should quantify PDs taking their own internal data into consideration. In cases where institutions use external or pooled data series to complement their internal data for the purpose of PD quantification, the more internal default experience an institution has, the less importance it needs to give to external data. In addition, institutions should ensure that these external or pooled data series are representative in accordance with Section 3.2 of this guide. 64 To comply with the requirement for the data to be representative and as part of their representativeness analysis, institutions should ensure that the observed average default rates from external data or from the external part of the pooled data are calculated separately from, and compared with, those based on internal data. 65 This comparison should be made at the levels at which the observed average default rate is to be calculated. 66 In accordance with paragraph 79 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the comparison should be made for each rating grade or pool and for the type of exposures covered by the relevant PD model, as well as for any relevant calibration segment. The direction and magnitude of the differences between these averages should be properly analysed and documented when calibrating the model, taking into account the distributions 67 of obligors across grades and calibration segments, where relevant, and including the need and adequacy of the category A MoC considered with regard to paragraph 37(a)(viii) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, and duly followed up in the review of estimates. Where the results of this comparison show material differences between the internal and external observed average default rates at any of the three levels mentioned which cannot be explained by differences in the distribution across grades and calibration segments, the ECB considers this is an indication that the representativeness of the external data is not proven.|403
2187|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 126|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.2 Calculation of the one-year default rate and observed average default rates|126. To assess whether the parameter estimates are biased as per paragraph 38 of this chapter, institutions should compare the LRA default rate using only internal data with the average PD estimates (before adding an MoC) resulting from their application to the internal exposures over the set of all reference dates within the period representative of the likely range of variability. In the ECB's view, the estimates are biased if either of the following conditions are met: (a) at calibration segment level, there are material differences between the average of the two previous elements of comparison; or (b) at grade level, there are systematic differences (i.e. the direction of the differences is not random). It is the ECB's understanding that the identification of material differences in (a) and systematic differences in (b) should not rely only on considerations of statistical significance. In the ECB's view, the lack of statistical evidence that a PD estimate and the corresponding LRA default rate based on internal data (at calibration segment in (a) and grade level in (b)) are different is not sufficient to conclude that no material difference exists. For clarity, the ECB considers this quantitative analysis to be independent of and complementary to the calibration tests required by paragraph 87 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. These calibration tests should be performed on the data used for the calibration (including external/pooled data used in the calculation of the default rates and in the calculation of the average PD on the calibration sample).|335
2188|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 127|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|127. To calculate the LRA default rate, institutions should follow paragraphs 82 to 86 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. If an institution makes adjustments to the observed average default rates in order to obtain LRA default rates under paragraph 85(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, these adjustments should be based on (external) default rates, or - if no appropriate default rates are available - on other observed indicators relevant for the type of exposures considered.|132
2189|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 128|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|"128. For the purpose of assessing the representativeness of the historical observation period used for the likely range of variability of one-year default rates under paragraph 83 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the following should be taken into account. 
(a) Where the scarcity of internal exposures and/or defaults might unduly influence the variability of internally observed default rates (i.e. where the variability driven by statistical uncertainty is so high in comparison with the structural variability of default rates that it hampers any analysis of them), institutions should assess whether external or pooled default rate series can be used to identify the relevant historical observation period for the likely range of variability of one-year default rates. The external or pooled default series used should be relevant for the specific portfolio at least in terms of geographical composition, sectoral distribution and other relevant risk drivers. When no relevant default rate series can be identified, the items described in paragraphs 83(b) and 83(c) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD should play a crucial role in the assessment. 
(b) When taking into account the existence of one-year default rates relating to bad years as reflected in economic indicators that are relevant for the considered types of exposures within the historical observation period as referred to in paragraph 83(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should ensure that such indicators are relevant for the portfolio at least in the terms of geographical composition, sectoral distribution and other risk drivers relevant to the portfolio."|334
2190|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 129|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|129. With respect to calibration to the LRA default rate, institutions should follow paragraphs 87 to 99 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.|65
2191|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 130|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|"130. For the purposes of complying with the provisions of paragraph 92 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, it is the ECB's understanding that all the following principles apply. 
(a) Institutions should document the rationale of their adopted approach and provide evidence that, irrespective of whether the calibration considers (i) the LRA default rate at grade or pool level according to paragraph 92(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD or (ii) the LRA default rate at calibration segment level according to paragraph 92(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the PD estimates are adequate both at grade or pool level and at calibration segment level. In any case, all the requirements on risk differentiation referred to in the applicable regulation apply. The ECB's understanding of these requirements is set out in Section 5.1.2 of this chapter. In particular, it follows from the applicable rules that under no circumstances should an approach be adopted to overcome data scarcity at grade or pool level, lack of evidence of discriminatory capacity, homogeneity or heterogeneity across grades. 
(b) Regardless of the level at which institutions consider the LRA default rate in accordance with paragraph 92 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, in the ECB's view the LRA default rate needs to be calculated at grade or pool level and at calibration segment level since these LRA default rates are required either directly for calibration purposes or indirectly in order to provide meaningful additional calibration tests. 
(c) For the purposes of obtaining the LRA default rate at grade or pool level and at calibration segment level, the availability of long series of observed one-year default rates covering the full period representative of the likely range of variability of default rates is of utmost importance. The ECB expects institutions to take all reasonable efforts to obtain such long series with sufficient data quality in line with the provisions of paragraph 70 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD."|427
2192|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 130|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|"In the specific case of changes in the method for assigning exposures to grades or pools, and in accordance with paragraph 98(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should make all reasonable efforts to recalculate the new assignment back through time covering the full period representative of the likely range of variability of default rates, as such grade or pool level information is necessary to obtain long series of one-year default rates at grade or pool level. Institutions should duly justify and document situations where backwards recalculation is not possible. Additionally, in the exceptional cases where such recalculation is not possible, institutions should assess whether the use of the historical rating assignments based on previous versions of the assignment methodology would be adequate. 
(d) Without prejudice to the application of adequate methodologies to correct identified deficiencies in order to overcome biases in risk parameter estimates as required in paragraph 38 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, in cases where long series of one-year default rates are available at grade or pool level and calibration segment level covering the period representative of the likely range of variability of default rates, in accordance with paragraph 84 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD the LRA default rate should be computed as the observed average of one-year default rates at grade or pool level and calibration segment level in that period. 
(e) Where an institution is unable to obtain long series of one-year default rates as described in point (c) above, the underlying reasons should be duly justified and documented. In any case, in accordance with point (b) above, the ECB expects institutions to estimate the LRA default rate at grade or pool level, and calibration segment level by adjusting the observed average of one-year default rates, where necessary, in accordance with paragraph 85 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. The adjustment should at least be reflective 68 of the number of good and bad years in the available data with respect to the number of good and bad years applicable to the period representative of the likely range of variability. This means that where the number of bad years is underrepresented in the available data, upward adjustments should be made to the observed average of one-year default rates, unless the institution is able to provide empirical evidence that the level of observed one-year default rates is unrelated to the years being good or bad. The adjustment must be reflective of the variability of the default rates, meaning that the larger the variability in the default rates, the larger the necessary adjustments might be. As a consequence, in the case of the LRA default rate at grade level, the necessary adjustment depends on the grade assignment dynamics among other things."|564
2193|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 130|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|Moreover, institutions should duly analyse and document the need for an MoC in accordance with Article 46(3)(b) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439 and in accordance with paragraph 42 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, which requires the MoC to reflect in particular the uncertainty related to the deficiencies referred to in paragraph 37(a)(iii) and 37(a)(x) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. In the ECB's understanding, and in line with paragraph 43(a)(ii) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the larger the adjustments to the observed average of one-year default rates and the larger the unavailable time period in proportion to the period representative of the likely range of variability of default rates, the larger the uncertainty of the adjustments and hence the greater the need for and magnitude of such an MoC.|218
2194|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 131|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|131. Where, for calibration purposes, the LRA default rate is considered at the level of grade or pool in accordance with paragraph 92(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, it is the ECB's understanding that the PD (before MoC) of each grade or pool should be equal to the LRA default rate of each grade or pool. This is without prejudice to the provisions of the next paragraph.|119
2195|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 132|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|132. Where an institution adopts the approach referred to in paragraph 92(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, it should provide additional tests at the level of the relevant calibration segment. To this end, as part of the estimation and ongoing monitoring of its models, an institution should, at least, compare the LRA PD at calibration segment level with the LRA default rate at calibration segment. In performing this comparison, the institution should calculate the LRA PD at calibration segment level as the arithmetic 69 average across time 70 of the (arithmetic) average PD at calibration segment level for each reference date. Deviations should be analysed and documented, and should trigger adequate remedial action where necessary. Where an institution does not explicitly define calibration segments as subsets of the range of application of the PD model, a single calibration segment covering the whole range of application of the PD model must be considered for the above-mentioned test.|222
2196|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 133|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|"133. Where, for calibration purposes, the LRA default rate is considered at calibration segment level in accordance with paragraph 92(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should be aware of situations where divergences between the LRA default rate at a grade level and the grade level PD value could arise. These situations include the following. 
(a) The use of a calibration sample for the purposes of obtaining the adjustment to be made to the scores/raw PDs at grade level in order to meet the LRA default rate at calibration segment level which is not fully representative of the likely range of variability of default rates may result in PD estimates at grade level which are lower than the LRA default rate at grade level. This could happen, for example, when the grade assignment is to some extent sensitive to the economic conditions$^{71}$, and bad years are over-represented in the calibration sample, in which case a biased adjustment may be obtained as a result of the distribution across grades of the calibration sample being overpopulated in riskier grades compared with the sample corresponding to the period of the LRA default rate. 
(b) The use of a calibration sample 72 for the purposes of obtaining the scores/raw PDs at grade level or the use of a calibration methodology where the discriminatory power implied by the PDs at grade level is not consistent with the discriminatory power implied by the observed average of the one-year default rates at grade level from the sample corresponding to the period of the LRA default rate 73 may result in PD estimates at grade level which do not reflect the LRA default rate at grade level."|370
2197|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 134|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|134. The ECB expects that institutions will duly justify the choice of the calibration sample and methodology and in particular assess its adequacy in terms of situations (a) and (b) mentioned in the previous paragraph.|74
2198|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 135|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|135. Where an institution adopts the approach referred to in paragraph 92(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, it should perform additional tests as part of the development and ongoing monitoring of its models to ensure that the final (postcalibration) PDs reflect the LRA default rate of each grade. Specifically, institutions should ensure that there are no systematic deviations when comparing the estimated PDs with the LRA default rate of the grades, i.e. the direction of divergences across grades should be random regardless of the materiality or statistical significance of the deviations. For example, deviations (statistically material or not) occurring in a given direction for a number of consecutive grades are understood by the ECB to be systematic deviations.|182
2199|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 135|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|In any case, even if the deviations are not systematic, the ECB expects institutions to demonstrate that such grade-level deviations do not distort the RWEA calculations. For that purpose, institutions should analyse any material difference between the RWEAs resulting from the current calibration and the RWEAs resulting from the application of alternative PDs calculated on the basis of the LRA default rate at grade level for the application portfolio, and reach a conclusion on the appropriateness of the adopted methodology on the basis of such a comparison.|135
2200|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 136|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|136. Under paragraph 87 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should have sound and well-defined processes in place to ensure sound calibration including quantitative calibration tests and supplementary qualitative analyses. It is the ECB's understanding that, as part of these tests, institutions should compare the average PD (before MoC) at calibration segment level with the one-year default rate and with the LRA default rate at calibration segment level for each of the calculation dates adopted for LRA default rate calculation$^{74}$. Institutions should reach a conclusion on the appropriateness of the final (postcalibration) PD level at calibration segment on the basis of such comparisons and by taking into consideration the grade assignment dynamics of the PD model.|179
2201|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 137|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.3 Calibration to the LRA default rate|137. Under paragraph 89 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should ensure that for the purpose of calibrating PD estimates to the LRA default rate, any overrides applied in the assignment of obligors to grades or pools are taken into account. However, where the appropriate consideration of overrides in the calibration process is not possible, institutions should apply an appropriate adjustment (AA) to the extent possible and a corresponding MoC to account for the uncertainty associated with the lack of consideration of overrides within the model calibration. In order to evaluate the need for an AA and an MoC and to quantify them, institutions may, for example, use the outcome of a re-rating of a representative sample (including the application of the new overrides policy if applicable) at a recent date. In addition, the appropriateness of this MoC should be reviewed during the review of estimates, also taking into consideration the impact of the overrides on the ratings of the whole portfolio after implementation of the new model in the production environment.|238

Notwithstanding paragraph 127, for retail exposures institutions need not give equal importance to historical data if more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates. 75 In the understanding of the ECB an institution may consider that the more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates and may give more importance to recent historical data if the following apply. 
(a) There is a significant improvement in the predictive power when using the more recent data with respect to the predictive power resulting from the use of an arithmetic average under paragraph 81 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. This improvement should be evidenced by comparing the estimated PDs for each grade with the realised default rates covering as long a period as possible, in accordance with Article 185(b) of the CRR. 
(b) Older data are considered as non-representative as a result of specific policy or business changes in the bank, but not in order to reflect current trends in default rates directly related to macroeconomic conditions. 
(c) The weighting approach is used in a consistent manner over time and any change in the applied weights of historical data is appropriately justified."|258
2203|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 139|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.5 PD quantification based on mapping to external grades|139. The ECB interprets the possibility for institutions to attribute the default rate observed for the grades of a rating agency or similar organisation to its own grades in accordance with Article 180(1)(f) of the CRR as being equivalent to the use of external data for PD quantification at a more aggregated level (external grade) rather than at the obligor/facility level. Accordingly, Sections 3.2 and 5.2.2 of this chapter are relevant for institutions that do so.|137
2204|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 140|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.5 PD quantification based on mapping to external grades|"140. In accordance with Article 180(1)(f) of the CRR, mappings must be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria with the criteria used by the external organisation and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common obligors. Biases or inconsistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data must be avoided. To comply with these requirements, institutions should follow the paragraphs listed below. 
(a) Institutions should ensure that the quality of the mapping between internal and external rating scales at a given date and over time is consistent and provides for an adequate level of predictive ability. 
(b) When mapping internal grades to external grades, institutions should document and analyse any differences between the external and internal rating criteria. 
(c) The use of common obligors as a basis for the mapping should take into account their representativeness for the application portfolio. 
(d) Institutions should adjust the external rating scale if such rating scale does not solely embed default risk. 76 They should also document such adjustments. 
(e) When mapping internal grades to external grades and using the default rates of the external grades provided by the organisation, if the latter has a material number of entities for which it no longer provides a rating (withdrawn rating), the institution should take this into account. It should adjust the external default rates accordingly, if necessary, and take into consideration the provisions of paragraph 75 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. In the event that an adjustment is performed, the institution should add the necessary MoC."|342
2205|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 141|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.6 Specific requirements for direct PD estimates|"141. In order to use direct PD estimates for the calculation of own funds requirements in accordance with Article 169(3) of the CRR, institutions should follow paragraphs 96 and 98(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. To assess whether the theoretical assumptions of the probability model underlying the estimation methodology are satisfied to a sufficient extent in practice under paragraph 96 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should do the following. 
(a) Ensure good risk differentiation properties across the full PD range of the rating system. 
(b) Have an adequate and documented concept in place specifying the calibration function currently implemented (concrete functional form), including the underlying theoretical assumptions and the established processes to conduct the PD calibration. It is the ECB's understanding that institutions should ensure consistency between the score-inferred PDs and the observed default rates and should understand and justify the transformation of the scores into PD values. 
(c) Ensure that any transformation of the scores resulting from the probability model that is applied during the calibration does not change the ranking of the obligors/facilities (in other words, co-monotonicity between scores/raw PDs and PD values should be ensured). Moreover, institutions should avoid any undue influence of extreme values of score-inferred PDs on the shape of the calibration function. Additionally, and when institutions use different calibration functions for different sub-ranges, they should ensure that this mix is appropriate (both in terms of the functional forms used and the cut-offs selected) and that it is appropriately justified. 
(d) Ensure that there is a relevant number of observations across the whole range of score-inferred PDs. Particular interest should be paid to situations where the probability model is extended to ranges of PD values where there are not enough defaulted observations. 
(e) Ensure that there are no excessive concentrations of exposures or obligors within the PD range of the rating system. In addition, high concentrations of observations in a specific range of score-inferred PDs should be properly analysed and justified in terms of homogeneity. 
(f) For the purpose of performing the additional tests at grade level referred to in paragraph 92(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, grades should be understood as sub-ranges of PD values. These sub-ranges should be defined in a way that: 
(i) represents sufficiently narrow ranges of PD values; 
(ii) contains a sufficient number of observations to ensure a meaningful calculation of the LRA default rate of the sub-range."|540
2206|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 142|PD modelling|Credit risk > 5 Probability of default > 5.2 PD risk quantification > 5.2.6 Specific requirements for direct PD estimates|142. In cases where institutions map the PDs to a masterscale (defined in terms of PD bounds) as a final step in the PD estimation process (using masterscale discrete PDs for the purpose of RWEA calculation), there is a risk that the mapping process could distort RWEAs. To mitigate this risk, institutions should verify that deviations between the masterscale PDs and the average of the direct PDs assigned to obligors in each grade do not show a systematic or material bias towards underestimation of PD per grade over time. This analysis should be provided for both the portfolio and for each grade.|156
2207|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 143|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.2 Reference dataset|143. Under paragraph 102 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should estimate LGDs on the basis of their own loss or recovery experience.$^{77}$ Institutions may supplement their own historical data on defaulted exposures with external data. The more own loss experience (i.e. the more internal defaults) an institution has, the less importance it needs to give to external data. Institutions should ensure that their own historical experience contains a minimum number of defaults in order to determine whether external data are sufficiently representative.|131
2208|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 144|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.2 Reference dataset|144. To ensure that LGD estimations are accurate and are not underestimated as a result of different external and internal recovery processes, institutions should place greater importance on comparisons of internal recovery processes with the recovery processes underlying the external data, in cases where a high weight is assigned to external data. Where limited representativeness of external data is found, a category A MoC should be considered, in order to reflect the uncertainty of the estimation under paragraph 37(a)(viii) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. Its magnitude should also be quantified in relation to the weight assigned to the external data.|152
2209|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 145|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.2 Reference dataset|"145. When institutions use information derived from the market price of defaul ted financ ial instruments to supplement their internal loss or recovery experience data, there is a risk of misspecification of their LGD estimates. To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure the following: 
(a) institutions should verify whether the development sample is representative of the application portfolio at least in terms of regions and product type, even when those variables have not been identified as relevant risk drivers; 
(b) losses derived from market prices should be increased to reflect indirect costs, as specified in paragraph 146 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD."|153
2210|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 146|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|146. Article 4(1)(55) of the CRR defines LGD as the ratio of the loss on an exposure due to the default of a counterparty to the amount outstanding at default. For the purposes of Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions are required to calculate realised LGD. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should calculate realised LGD under paragraphs 100 to 103 and 131 to 146 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.|140
2211|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 146|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|In addition, when performing this calculation institutions should follow the observations in the succeeding paragraphs.|46
2212|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 147|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|147. In accordance with Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, institutions must have estimates of LGD in-default and EL BE on defaulted exposures. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that all principles regarding the calculation of realised LGD should be applied for the estimation of LGD on nondefaulted exposures and for the estimation of LGD in-default and EL BE on defaulted exposures, unless mentioned otherwise (that is, if the reference date is considered instead of the date of default).|136
2213|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 148|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|148. Where, in the case of retail exposures and purchased corporate receivables, institutions derive LGD estimates from realised losses and appropriate estimates of PDs in accordance with Articles 161(2) and 181(2)(a) of the CRR and under paragraph 103 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, all the principles regarding realised LGD should apply to realised losses.|111
2214|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 149|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|149. Institutions must document the specific definitions of default and loss used internally and ensure that they are consistent with the definitions set out in the CRR. 78 To comply with these requirements, institutions should have in place sufficiently detailed policies and procedures to ensure that the realised LGD is calculated consistently and accurately, including the implementation of the definition of economic loss. These policies and procedures should include sufficiently detailed documentation to allow third parties to replicate the calculation of realised LGD. To ensure that the policies and procedures are implemented in an appropriate and adequate manner, the calculation process should be regularly reviewed by an independent unit.|151
2215|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 150|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|150. In accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR and under paragraph 100 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should calculate the realised LGD at facility level for each default. In line with paragraph 112 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, where aggregated information is collected and stored, the realised LGD at facility level may be calculated using this more aggregated information, in which case institutions should define a proper methodology for the allocation of recoveries and costs to each individual facility. The ECB expects institutions to duly justify and document the underlying reasons for the collection and storage at a more aggregated level than facility level.|166
2216|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 151|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|"151. In exceptional cases, the ECB considers institutions to be compliant with the requirement to calculate realised LGD at facility level if they can prove that the recovery is not performed at individual facility level but at a more aggregated level (for example, several facilities of the same or different types secured by the same collateral). The realised LGD can therefore be calculated at a more aggregated level than individual facility level. For this exceptional deviation from the calculation of realised LGD at facility level to be acceptable, institutions should: 
(a) provide evidence that recovery at aggregated level is legally enforceable. 
(b) on a regular basis (as often as review of estimates is performed or more often), provide evidence that recovery at a more aggregated level than single facility level is in practice enforced. This evidence should be based on the institution's historical practice and data and demonstrate that both the recovery process and its outcomes in terms of realised loss or recovery are the same for all the facilities considered at the aggregated level. Specifically, institutions should be able to prove that all collateral within an aggregation is called irrespective of the product triggering default (thus, for a current account as for a home loan) and that realised loss or observed recovery is the same for all types of facility within the aggregation. 
(c) for retail exposures where institutions use the definition of default at facility level set out in the last sentence of Article 178(1) of the CRR, ensure that the default is triggered for all aggregated facilities. 
(d) In addition, institutions following this approach should: 
(e) ensure that the parameters are applied in a manner that is consistent with how they have been estimated, i.e. across aggregated facilities; 
(f) ensure that the counting unit used for the purposes of risk quantification is at this aggregated level; 
(g) ensure that no bias results from the aggregation of facilities, by validating the estimates (PD, LGD, CCF) at the more aggregated level also."|423
2217|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 152|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|"152. As mentioned in paragraph 146, for the purposes of Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR institutions are required to calculate realised LGD, which is defined by Article 4(1)(55) of the CRR as the ratio of the loss on an exposure due to the default of a counterparty to the amount outstanding at default. Furthermore, Article 5(2) of the CRR defines loss as an economic loss, including material discount effects, and material direct and indirect costs associated with collecting on the instrument. In accordance with these provisions, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should calculate realised LGD as a ratio of the economic loss to the outstanding amount of the credit obligation at the moment of default, including any amount of principal, interest or fee (hereinafter outstanding amount at default). To calculate realised LGD, institutions should follow paragraphs 131 to 146 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. In addition, they should pay particular attention to the following points. 
(a) Outstanding amount at default includes any part of the exposure that has been forgiven or written off before or at the date of default (paragraph 134 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD). Institutions should ensure consistency with the accounting value gross of credit risk adjustment"|293
2218|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 152|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|"(i.e. ""provisions"") (Article 166(1) of the CRR) by explaining any differences. This amount also includes interest and fees capitalised in the institution's income statement before the moment of default. However, interest and fees capitalised after the moment of default are not considered (paragraphs 137 to 138 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD). Where institutions include additional drawings after the moment of default to estimate CCFs, these additional drawings discounted to the moment of default are added to the outstanding amount at default in the denominator (paragraphs 139 to 142 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD). In other words, institutions should ensure that the exposure used for CCF estimation, where additional drawings after default are discounted with the same discount factor as applied for LGD, is consistent with the denominator of the LGD. 
(b) Economic loss is calculated under paragraph 132 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. This also applies in the specific case of facilities that return to non-defaulted status, where losses arising from payment delays are expected to be accounted for as well as the ""artificial cash flow"" envisaged by paragraph 135 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. 
(c) When recoveries are not directly observed but calculated on the basis of the difference between exposure values at two consecutive dates or derived, even partially, from some other treatment, all assumptions should be duly justified and clearly documented in order to adequately replicate the recovery flows that occur during the recovery process in accordance with letters a) and b) above. Institutions are expected to pay particular attention to the treatment of interest and fees capitalised after default, the treatment of additional drawings and the treatment of write-offs."|387
2219|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 153|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.3 Calculation of realised LGD|"153. The economic loss as defined in Article 5(2) of the CRR also includes material discounts. The ECB's understanding is as follows. 
(a) Paragraph 134 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD refers to all losses incurred through forgiveness or write-off. 
(b) Where institutions open new facilities to replace previously defaulted facilities as part of restructuring or for technical reasons, the economic loss should include the decrease in the degree of financial obligation arising from changes in the contractual conditions (i.e. material forgiveness or postponement of payment of principal, interest or fees). The amount by which the financial obligation has diminished should be calculated under paragraph 51 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD. However, no doublecounting of debt forgiveness is intended (for example, in the case of exposures that return to non-defaulted status, a possible double-counting through the diminished financial obligation and the artificial cash flow is not intended). 
(c) Realised LGD for individual facilities may be zero or lower when it is the actual result of the recovery process (for example, where additional recoveries offset the discounting effect and costs). Institutions should, however, pay particular attention to no-loss exposures, since they may reveal issues with the calculation of realised losses - for example, costs not being adequately allocated to recovery processes, or inadequate treatment of amounts forgiven or written off."|308
2220|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 154|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.1 Realised LGD > 6.1.4 Treatment of multiple defaults|"154. For the purpose of LGD estimation and in order to ensure an appropriate measurement of economic loss as defined in Article 5(2) of the CRR, institutions should consider an exposure that returns to normal status and subsequently defaults in a short period of time as being constantly defaulted from the moment the first default occurred. This treatment should be applied under paragraph 101 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. In addition, institutions should follow the observations in the following paragraphs. 
(a) Paragraph 101 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD envisages the definition of a period longer than nine months when this is appropriate for the specific type of exposures and reflects the economic meaning of the default experience. It is the ECB's understanding that a longer period is adequate when the proportion of subsequent defaults occurring on individual facilities over a period of more than nine months is significant, unless institutions are able to provide evidence that the second (or subsequent) default is unconnected with the original default event. This evidence may include analysis of the curing process. 
(b) In the particular case of an institution opening new facilities to replace previously defaulted facilities as part of restructuring or for technical reasons, it should be able to make or trace a connection between the restructured facility and the facility (or facilities) previously advanced and which it is restructuring."|298

An institution must qualify for the use of Article 500 of the CRR by meeting the conditions set out therein, or be a subsidiary or parent of an institution which thus qualifies. In the case of a parent, the ECB considers that the adjustment at the consolidated level should reflect the adjustment conducted by the qualifying subsidiary or subsidiaries only. In other words, if the parent does not by itself meet the conditions of Article 500, any additional defaults that are not defaults of the subsidiary that qualifies for the use of Article 500 CRR may not be part of the adjustment pursuant to Article 500 CRR at the consolidated level of the parent.|169

Article 500(1)(c) of CRR sets out a threshold condition that must be met in order to qualify for the use of this Article. The denominator of the 20% threshold must be understood as the outstanding amount of defaulted exposures as of the date of the first disposal according to the plan submitted to the competent authority.$^{80}$ It is the ECB's understanding that the threshold condition should be evaluated at the level of the institution submitting the plan referred to in Article 500(1)(a) of the CRR.|149

With respect to whether the inclusion of foreclosed assets (the repossession and sale of collateral as referred to in paragraph 115(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD) in the Article 500 adjustment is permissible, the ECB considers it important to distinguish between the sale of an exposure and the sale of collateral. Only the former, but not the latter, is covered by Article 500 of the CRR. Consequently, since Article 500 of the CRR refers to the use of defaulted exposures for the calculation of the threshold and the adjustment itself, foreclosed assets cannot be included in either.|164

It is the ECB's understanding 81 that ""the average estimated LGDs for comparable exposures in default that have not been finally liquidated"" can be calculated based on the institution's incomplete workout treatment applied to the exposures as of the date before the date of their disposal. This calculation implies an adjustment back to the estimated LGD that would have occurred if the standard workout process had been followed instead of the massive disposals process. Where an institution follows this approach, it should ensure the following. 
(a) The requirements related to the institution's incomplete workout treatment should be in line with paragraphs 153 to 159 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. In particular, the uncertainty referred to in 159(f) will persist indefinitely, and so the related MoC will also have to persist as long as the adjusted observations are used for the estimation of parameters. 
(b) During the annual review of estimates of its LGD models, it should be assessed whether the use of newly available information would increase the accuracy of the Article 500 adjustment performed in the past. For this purpose the institution should have pre-defined, internally approved criteria to decide whether the accuracy of the Article 500 adjustment can be increased. If the accuracy can be increased, the institutions should perform a new Article 500 adjustment by incorporating this new relevant data and information in accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, including appropriate documentation showing that the pre-defined criteria have been met. The ECB expects the update to the Article 500 adjustment to reflect the (economic) conditions and processes as of the date of disposal and not as of the date of the adjustment. 
(c) It is expected that once a sufficiently long time has passed since the massive disposal, there will be no new information that can be considered relevant for the adjustment (in particular, a sufficiently long time may be considered to have passed once most of the cases that were incomplete as of the date of the disposals have been closed or if the maximum period of the recovery process has been reached as of the time of the estimation). If this is the case, it will not be necessary to modify the Article 500 adjustment performed in previous calibrations. The supervised entity should monitor whether most cases that were incomplete as of the date of the disposal have been closed. If this is the case, it should conclude that a sufficiently long period of time has passed and make a final assessment of whether the adjustment needs to be updated. The specific MoC related to the uncertainty of the cash flows should be reviewed in accordance with the MoC framework, taking newly available information into account for the same sufficiently long period of time."|577

The data used to develop the incomplete workout treatment should be representative of the portfolio of disposed assets. The institution should have criteria in place to assess representativeness by comparing key characteristics of the portfolios in line with paragraph 37(b)(ii) and Sections 4.2.2 to 4.2.4 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. Any issues of representativeness should be appropriately reflected in the MoC related to the Article 500 adjustment.|137

Regarding the treatment of incomplete workouts, in order to avoid circular logic if the Article 500 adjustment is based on the incomplete workout treatment, then from the date of the massive disposal onwards, and in the case of disposed assets only, supervised entities are not expected to analyse costs and recoveries as described in paragraph 159(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.|117

It is the ECB's understanding that all the defaults subject to the massive disposal adjustment should be treated as closed observations. In particular, they should be treated as such for the purpose of determining the maximum period of the recovery process as referred to in paragraph 156 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD with the date of the massive disposal as the closure date, unless institutions can provide firm evidence that this approach has a significant and unjustifiable biasing impact$^{82}$.|137

A grade or pool is understood by the ECB to be the subset of facilities to which the same LGD is applied for the calculation of regulatory capital requirements, irrespective of how this LGD has been assigned.|70
2239|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 171|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.2 LGD structure > 6.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|171. In order to comply with the requirements regarding the structure of LGD models as set out in Article 170(1)(e) and (f) and 170(3)(b) and (c) of the CRR, institutions should follow the observations below.|83
2240|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 172|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.2 LGD structure > 6.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|"172. LGD estimates must be based on the material drivers of risk. 83 To comply with this requirement, institutions should identify and analyse potential risk drivers under paragraphs 121 to 123 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. 84 When selecting the risk drivers, institutions should take into consideration any changes in product mix or characteristics between the reference and default dates. According to paragraph 122 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, ""institutions should analyse the risk drivers not only at the moment of default but also at least within a year before default and should use reference dates for risk drivers that are representative of the realisations of the risk drivers within a year before default"". In the ECB's understanding, this means that the choice of reference dates for risk drivers should ensure consistency with the expected distribution of defaults over the one-year horizon (and corresponding changes in the value of the risk driver) that are expected for the exposures to which the estimates are applied. In this context, where risk drivers vary over time, an approach consisting of a fixed (for all defaults) time horizon before default, particularly where this time horizon is less than 12 months, should not be used unless the institution is able to show that such an approach does not result in a lack of representativeness (in the sense of the previous sentence) leading to the final LGD estimates (at grade or pool level) being underestimated."|314
2241|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 173|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.2 LGD structure > 6.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|173. Where an institution relies on one or more statistical models to define the process of assigning exposures to facility grades or pools (or parts of this process) in accordance with Article 175(4)(b) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that for institutions to comply with the requirement set out in Article 144(1)(a) of the CRR that rating systems should provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk as further explained in letters (c) and (e) of Article 30(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439, the statistical process followed by the institution in selecting its model(s) should include assessing the performance of the model(s) on the basis of independent datasets (data points which were left out of the model fitting) in a way that limits the risk of overfitting. Independent datasets should correspond not only to random sampling (out-ofsample), but also to different time periods (out-of-time) unless there are no sufficient data available for the training sample. The expectations set out above in this paragraph are specifically related to the model development phase. Once the process for assigning exposures to facility grades or pools has been defined, the requirements related to the framework for the review of estimates under paragraphs 217 to 221 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD apply, together with the expectations set out in Section 9 of this guide. In particular, in accordance with paragraph 218(b)(i) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the institution must carry out an analysis to identify any potential deterioration in the model's performance, including the model's discriminatory power, by comparing its performance at the time of the development with its performance over each subsequent observation period.|383
2242|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 174|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.2 LGD structure > 6.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|174. Institutions' rating systems must provide for a meaningful assessment of obligor and transaction characteristics, a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk. 85 It is the ECB's understanding that to comply with this requirement institutions should demonstrate that, in terms of the range of application of LGD models, the model performs adequately (in terms of discriminatory power and predictive power) on economically significant and material sub-ranges of application of the rating systems. The sub-ranges are identified by splitting the full range of application of the LGD model into different parts on the basis of potential drivers for risk differentiation, among which, where relevant, the drivers referred to in paragraph 121 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.|176
2243|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 175|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.2 LGD structure > 6.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|"175. The number of grades and pools must be adequate for a meaningful risk differentiation and for the quantification of the LGD at the grade or pool level.$^{86}$ To comply with this requirement, institutions should ensure the following 
(a) an adequate distribution of facilities across grades or pools in the datasets used for development and (initial and regular) validation. For this purpose: 
(i) any unusually low number of facilities in a grade or pool is expected to be supported by empirical evidence of the adequacy of isolating those facilities in a specific grade or pool; 
(ii) any unusually high concentration of facilities in a grade or pool is expected to be supported by empirical evidence of homogeneity within these grades or pools (for example by analysing whether some potential risk drivers (e.g. exposure size) that could further differentiate between riskier and less risky facilities have not been considered). 
(b) sufficient homogeneity of the risk within each grade or pool by providing empirical evidence that the grade-level LGD is adequate for all facilities in that grade. For this purpose, in cases where it is found (through the use of additional drivers or a different discretisation of the existing ones) that a material subset of facilities within a grade or pool yields a significantly different average realised LGD to that of the rest of the grade or pool, this is considered to indicate a lack of homogeneity. 
(c) sufficient heterogeneity of the risk across grades or pools by providing empirical evidence that the average realised LGD is different across consecutive grades or pools, for subsets for which there is a meaningful order."|347
2244|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 176|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.2 LGD structure > 6.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|"176. Where an institution uses direct estimates of risk parameters, these may be seen as estimates assigned to grades on a continuous rating scale. 87 In this case, in the ECB's understanding the same requirements apply when an institution uses direct estimates of risk parameters as apply to grade-based models. To comply with these requirements, institutions are expected to ensure risk differentiation in accordance with the following principles: 
(a) if the LGD estimates used to calculate the RWEAs are based on default weighted LRAs of realised LGDs for grades or pools, irrespective of whether at some point direct LGD estimates may have been used to define such grades or pools, this grade or pool level is the relevant one for the application of the principles set out in paragraph 175; 
(b) when the situation described in point (a) above does not apply and, instead, several components are estimated separately and then combined in order to obtain the direct LGD estimates at facility level, institutions should adequately analyse and reflect in the model possible dependencies between the components (e.g. through relevant risk drivers); 
(c) in the case of other direct LGD estimates (i.e. where no components are defined) the principles above are expected to be applied where relevant."|276
2245|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 177|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.2 LGD structure > 6.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|"177. In addition to paragraph 176 above and where several components are estimated separately and then combined in order to obtain the direct LGD estimates at facility level, there is a risk that a meaningful differentiation of risk will not be achieved at facility level. To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that no bias is introduced in the risk differentiation when combining the different components in order to obtain the final LGD estimate at facility level. Specifically: 
(a) the allocation of recovery flows to these components should be adequately documented and implemented in a consistent way where applicable; 
(b) risk differentiation (analogous to risk quantification) should be ensured with respect to facility level."|161
2246|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 178|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.2 Observed average LGD|178. To comply with the requirement of obtaining an LRA LGD in accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should calculate the observed average LGD under paragraphs 147, 148, 154-157 and 160 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. When performing this calculation, institutions should follow the principles set out below.|107
2247|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 179|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.2 Observed average LGD|179. Under paragraph 147 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, default observations that are triggered close to the time of the LGD estimation process (i.e. observations with a recent default when the LGD is being estimated) are part of the historical observation period and should be included in the RDS. Since for these recent defaults only limited information is available regarding the full recovery process, the treatment of incomplete recovery processes envisaged in paragraph 158 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD is more complex and could add uncertainty to the LGD estimates. It is the ECB's understanding that to mitigate this risk institutions may establish a minimum period of time during which the default should be observed in order for it to be considered in the calculation of the observed average LGD. This minimum period should be adequately justified and institutions should ensure that all relevant information regarding defaults observed for a shorter period (e.g. a change in the characteristics of defaults) is considered in the LGD estimates. In any case this period should not be longer than 12 months.|244
2248|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 180|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.2 Observed average LGD|"180. For the purposes of LGD estimation (and validation), long recovery processes are expected to be considered as closed under paragraph 156 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. The objective of defining the maximum period of the recovery process (""time-to-workout"") is to avoid situations where institutions give consideration to overly optimistic recoveries from open exposures that are already at a very advanced stage of the recovery process. To achieve this, the specification of the ""time-to-workout"" should be supported by evidence of the observed pace of recoveries and be consistent with the nature of the products concerned, the type of exposures and the operational recovery process. In addition, the institution should substantiate and clearly document the studies that support the formulation of the time-to-workout and should pay particular attention to the following. 
(a) The specific moment after the date of default at which nearly nil evolution of the average cumulative recovery rates is observed. For example, when the cumulative recovery curves show a pronounced increase after which they flatten out, the time spent in default after the significant increase occurs could be used directly as the time-to-workout, especially in the case of unsecured exposures. 
(b) The period of time after the date of default where the cumulative percentage of closed/recovered exposures flattens. 
(c) The number of exposures used to construct the curves referred to at letters (a) and (b) above, in order to identify situations where only a few cases contribute to the shape of the curves. 
(d) The expected recovery rate conditioned to vintages higher than the timeto-workout. 
(e) For secured exposures, the share of exposures for which recoveries from collateral have not yet been realised."|375
2249|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 181|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.3 Treatment of incomplete recovery processes|"181. In order to obtain an LRA LGD in accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should ensure that the relevant information from incomplete recovery processes is taken into account in a conservative manner. For this purpose, institutions should analyse their incomplete recovery processes and extract the information relevant for LGD estimation under paragraphs 153 to 159 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. In addition, institutions should: 
(a) justify and document their methodology for the treatment of incomplete recovery processes, and in particular how they take into account paragraph 159 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD; 
(b) for the purpose of paragraph 159(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD in particular, base the extrapolation of future recoveries on defaults arising from vintages (i.e. group of exposures which defaulted in a given period of time) for which, during the period already observed, similar average past recoveries have been realised on similar exposures; 
(c) in order to ensure transparency regarding the impact from the treatment of incomplete recovery processes, assess the sensitivity of the treatment with respect to the main assumptions."|267

In specific cases where institutions have taken possession of but not yet sold the collateral, there is a risk that the value of repossession might not adequately reflect the value of the repossessed collateral. To mitigate this risk, institutions should estimate haircuts to the value of the collateral under paragraphs 116 to 118 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. In order to ensure transparency regarding the impact from the treatment of repossessed collateral, institutions should: 
(a) compare the estimated haircuts with the available observations regarding the repossession and subsequent sale of similar types of collateral; 
(b) assess the impact on the LRA LGD of the inclusion of the repossessed collateral by performing sensitivity analyses based on the application of different haircuts to the value of the collateral (at least, by applying a haircut of 100% to cases where collateral has been repossessed but not yet sold)."|222
2251|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 183|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.5 Long-run average|183. To comply with the requirement of obtaining an LRA LGD by facility grade or pool in accordance with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should estimate LGDs under paragraphs 100 and 149 to 164 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. When performing this estimation, institutions should follow the observations below.|100
2252|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 184|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.5 Long-run average|"184. Under paragraph 150 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should calculate the LRA LGD as an arithmetic average of realised LGDs over a historical observation period weighted by a number of defaults. When performing this calculation, institutions should observe the following points. 
(a) In the event of definition of default applied at obligor level, where two facilities of the same obligor are assigned to the same facility grade or pool, institutions are expected to calculate the average realised LGD as follows: first take the exposure-weighted average realised LGD at the obligor level and then take the arithmetic average LGD weighted by the number of defaulted obligors within the LGD grade. If institutions use a different approach, they should demonstrate that there are no systematic deviations from the approach referred to above. 
(b) Under paragraph 160 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the realised LGD of each observation should be floored at zero for the purpose of LGD estimation. In cases where LGD estimates for specific facility grades or pools are low or even zero (in exceptional cases), in order to ensure that these estimates are accurate and not driven by (systematic) errors or distortions institutions should ensure that their estimation process is accurate. In particular, they should ensure that there is a sufficient number of observations supporting the estimate and that these outcomes are carefully monitored and scrutinised. 
(c) Under paragraph 162 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should apply an appropriate treatment to extremely high values of realised LGDs much above 100%, at the level of data quality, risk drivers, assignment to grades or pools or assignment to calibration segments. To ensure that the estimates are accurate, institutions are not expected to cap realised LGD values (i.e. to replace the observed value by a pre-defined value when the observed value is above the pre-defined one)."|412
2253|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 185|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.5 Long-run average|185. Institutions can calibrate LGD estimates to the LRA LGD calculated at the level of the calibration segment under paragraph 161(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. When calibration segments are used for the purpose of LGD estimations, institutions are expected to base their decision on a sound rationale, in particular on quantitative evidence. It is the ECB's understanding that, to comply with Article 181(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions should also calculate the LRA LGD at a more granular level than the calibration segment (i.e. individual LGD grades or pools if estimation is discrete or ranges of LGD values if the estimation is continuous). The level should be appropriate for the application of the model. In addition, institutions should ensure that there are no systematic deviations when comparing the estimated LGDs with the LRA of realised LGDs at this more granular level, i.e. the direction of divergences should be random.|226
2254|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 186|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.5 Long-run average|"186. Where the LGD is the result of a combination of different components (for example, secured and unsecured components), the calibration step according to paragraph 185 (ensuring that the average realised LGD and the average estimated LGD across facilities within the same calibration segment/range of LGD values are aligned) is expected to be performed after the aggregation of the components. In addition, there is a risk that systematic deviations could be introduced to the estimation when combining these different components. In this case, the direction of divergences would not be random. To mitigate this risk, institutions should do the following. 
(a) For defaults in the RDS which are closed or considered closed, compare the realised LGD at facility level with the estimates of LGD. Separate tests should be performed for the LGD applied to the performing portfolio and the LGD in-default. Analogous tests should be performed at component level. 
(b) In the case of models based on components with underlying data covering time windows with different lengths and/or periods for each of the components, ensure that no bias is introduced in the LGD estimates at facility level with respect to the LRA. The analysis referred to in point (a) should be performed, at least, for the available common time period."|286
2255|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 187|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.5 Long-run average|"187. Notwithstanding paragraph 184, for retail exposures institutions need not give equal importance to historical data if more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates. 89 It is the ECB's understanding that an institution may consider the more recent data to be a better predictor of loss rates and may give more importance to recent historical data if its methodology is in line with paragraphs 150 to 152 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD and if the following apply. 
(a) There is a significant improvement in predictive power when using the more recent data with respect to the predictive power resulting from the use of an arithmetic average under paragraph 150 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. This improvement would be evidenced by comparing the estimated LGDs for each grade with the average realised LGD covering as long a period as possible in accordance with Article 185(b) of the CRR. 
(b) The oldest data are considered as non-representative as a result of specific policy or business changes in the bank, but not in order to reflect current trends in loss rates directly related to macroeconomic conditions. 
(c) The weighting approach is used in a consistent manner over time and any change in the applied weights of historical data is appropriately justified."|280
2256|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 188|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.5 Long-run average|188. In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, an institution's own estimates must incorporate all relevant data and must be derived using both historical experience and empirical evidence. To comply with these requirements, when institutions use external or pooled data to complement their own loss or recovery experience, they should ensure that LRA LGDs derived from external or pooled data are also calculated separately from, and compared with, those based on internal data$^{90}$. In addition, the direction and magnitude of the differences between these averages should be properly analysed and documented when calibrating the model, including the adequacy of the MoC considered, and duly followed up in the review of estimates.|169
2257|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 189|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.5 Long-run average|"189. Article 179(1)(d) of the CRR requires, among other things, that the population of exposures represented in the data used for estimation, the lending standards used when the data were generated and other relevant characteristics must be comparable with those of the institution's exposures and standards. Paragraph 164 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD further specifies that institutions should take into account not only the current characteristics of the portfolio but also, where relevant, any changes to the structure of the portfolio that are expected to happen in the foreseeable future. When institutions perform adjustments to their LGD estimates in order to comply with these requirements, it is the ECB's understanding that the following principles should apply. 
(a) The adjustment should be based on a comparison of the data used in risk quantification with the institution's application portfolio. In many circumstances (for example where a type of product has been discontinued by the institution), the addition of these characteristics as risk drivers for LGD estimation is the most simple and effective way of dealing with issues of non-representativeness. 
(b) In the event of changes in lending or recovery policies, institutions should make only conservative adjustments until they are able to provide empirical evidence concerning the impact of the new policies. Such evidence should be based on the inclusion in the RDS of data from periods more recent than the change of policy. 
(c) All economic and market conditions experienced in the past and reflected in historical observations should be considered by institutions as part of foreseeable economic and market conditions (paragraph 147 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD). They are not, therefore, a reason to perform adjustments."|360
2258|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 190|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.3 Risk quantification > 6.3.6 Downturn LGD|"190. To obtain LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn in accordance with Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions are expected to: 
(a) Characterise an economic downturn in accordance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2021/930; 
(b) derive LGD estimates which are appropriate for the downturn conditions specified, in accordance with the EBA Guidelines for the estimation of LGD appropriate for an economic downturn (""Downturn LGD estimation"")."|133

In accordance with Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, for the specific case of exposures already in default institutions must use the sum of their EL BE for each exposure, given current economic circumstances and exposure status and their estimate of the increased loss rate caused by possible additional unexpected losses during the recovery period. To comply with these requirements, institutions should estimate EL BE and LGD in-default under paragraphs 165 to|121
2260|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 191|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.4 Estimation of EL BE and LGD in-default > 6.4.1 Relevant regulatory references|193 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. 91 In this process, institutions should follow the observations below.|59
2261|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 192|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.4 Estimation of EL BE and LGD in-default > 6.4.1 Relevant regulatory references|192. In accordance with Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR, the EL BE must represent the best estimate of expected loss given current economic circumstances and exposure status. To comply with this requirement, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should take into consideration the economic conditions expected over the period of the recovery process, and in particular reflect downturn conditions in the EL BE , if and only if current economic conditions are in a downturn or a downturn is expected over the period of the recovery process. This can be done by adding the relevant macroeconomic and economic factors as drivers of the EL BE model, as would be the case for models complying with any condition of paragraph 184 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, or by adjusting the LRA as referred to in paragraph 185 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. Furthermore, in accordance with paragraph 184 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, if any of the conditions referred to in that paragraph is met (i.e. the model includes directly at least one macroeconomic factor as a risk driver, or at least one material risk driver is sensitive to economic conditions, or the realised LGD for defaulted exposures is not sensitive to the relevant economic factors), then in the ECB's understanding, the EL BE estimated on the basis of the LRA LGD reflects current economic circumstances as required by Article 181(1)(h) of the CRR and hence no further adjustments to the LRA LGD should be performed by institutions to reflect current economic circumstances. This means that, in the ECB's understanding, where paragraph 184 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD applies, the EL BE estimates should not deviate from the LRA LGD if the argument for the deviation is based on economic conditions. It is the ECB's understanding that institutions should appropriately account for paragraph 184 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD when back-testing their EL BE estimates in accordance with paragraph 170 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. To this end, where one of the conditions of paragraph 184 is met, the evolution of the EL BE estimates over time should be in accordance with that of the average realised LGD for defaulted exposures, although the variability of the EL BE time series may be lower than that of the average realised LGD for defaulted exposures.|514
2262|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 193|LGD modelling|Credit risk > 6 Loss given default > 6.4 Estimation of EL BE and LGD in-default > 6.4.1 Relevant regulatory references|"193. Under paragraph 193 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, LGD in-default can be estimated directly or as the sum of EL BE and an add-on capturing the unexpected loss related to the exposures in default that may occur during the recovery period. In particular, the following should be taken into consideration. 
(a) The use of a constant value for unexpected losses for all defaulted exposures is not risk sensitive. In the ECB's understanding, therefore, it does not allow an accurate assessment of risk. Where an institution does use a constant value, it should justify this. It should demonstrate that the constant value in question is an adequate estimate of all the components of unexpected loss envisaged in paragraph 193(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD during the remaining recovery period, i.e. between the date for which estimates are being applied and the final closure of the recovery process. This analysis should be performed at least for every calibration segment. 
(b) LGD in-default estimates are generally expected to be higher than EL BE estimates and only equal for duly justified individual exposures, which are expected to be very limited."|264

In accordance with Article 151(7) and (8) of the CRR, institutions must use own estimates of CCFs for the retail exposure class. If they have received permission to use own estimates for the corporate, institutional, central government and central bank exposure classes, they must again use own estimates of CCFs, instead of the conversion factors set out in in Article 166(8)(a) to (d) of the CRR. In both cases (retail and non-retail exposure classes), the scope of CCF modelling is, in the ECB's understanding, limited to the off-balance sheet items referred to in Article 166(8) of the CRR. 92 The treatment of off-balance-sheet items other than those mentioned in Article 166(1) to (8) of the CRR is specified in Article 166(10). In accordance with Article 166(10) of the CRR, an exposure value must be a specific percentage of an off-balance-sheet item's value, based on the classification of off-balance-sheet items established in Annex I of the CRR.|267

Conversion factor means the ratio of the currently undrawn amount of a commitment that could be drawn and that would therefore be outstanding at default to the currently undrawn amount of the commitment. The extent of the commitment is determined by the advised limit, unless the unadvised limit is higher. 93 The exposure value for the items listed in Article 166(8) of the CRR must be calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF. 94 To calculate the exposure value as required by Article 166(8) of the CRR, institutions should adopt the following approach. 
(a) Treat a facility as an exposure from the earliest date at which the facility is recorded in the institution's systems in a way that would allow the obligor to make a drawing. An unadvised limit is any credit limit defined by the institution (i) that is above the limit the obligor has been informed of by the institution; and (ii) according to which additional drawings are possible, at least temporarily. This higher (unadvised) credit limit may be disregarded if its availability is subject to a further credit assessment by the institution, as long as this additional assessment includes a re-rating or a confirmation of the rating of the obligor. 
(b) Consider as ""commitment"" any contractual arrangement that has been offered by the institution and accepted by the obligor to extend credit, purchase assets or issue credit substitutes. 
(c) Consider as ""conditionally cancellable commitment"" any such arrangement that can be and will be cancelled by the institution if the obligor fails to meet conditions set out in the facility documentation, including conditions that must be met by the obligor prior to any initial or subsequent drawdown under the arrangement. 
(d) Consider as ""credit lines"" all lines including products such as facilities granted for construction where the payments to the obligor are made according to the progress of the construction. Products such as guarantees are not, however, included in the concept of credit lines."|441

For institutions not using own estimates of CCFs for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks, Article 166(8) of the CRR defines the CCFs to be used for the purpose of calculating RWEA. In accordance with Article 166(8)(a) and (c) of the CRR, institutions not using their own estimates of CCFs for non-retail exposures are permitted to apply a 0% CCF, under certain conditions.|137
2266|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 196|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.1 Commitments, unadvised limits and scope of application > 7.1.1 Relevant regulatory references|It is the ECB's understanding that, to comply with the conditions established under Article 166(8)(a) and (c) of the CRR and to apply a 0% CCF, institutions should have in place internal control systems that allow them to monitor the obligor's financial condition and to act in the event that a deterioration in the obligor's credit quality is detected. They should also be able to provide evidence that the internal control systems work effectively. For this purpose, institutions should demonstrate that there is only a very limited number of exposures of a particular type observed during the previous year for which the EAD is higher than the drawn amount at the reference date. This analysis should be performed on a regular basis. The ECB considers it best practice when institutions perform this analysis on an annual basis.|196
2267|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 197|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.2 Realised CCFs > 7.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|"197. To ensure that a consistent and accurate approach is adopted to calculate the realised CCFs, institutions should have in place sufficiently detailed policies and procedures. For institutions to comply with the data-related requirements set out in Article 176(4) of the CRR, their RDS: 
(a) should not be capped at the principal amount outstanding or at facility limits; 
(b) should include all credit obligations (paragraph 16 of the EBA Guidelines on DoD), especially accrued interest, other due payments (e.g. fees) and limit excesses."|142
2268|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 198|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.2 Realised CCFs > 7.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|"198. In accordance with Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must calculate the realised CCF at facility level for each default. In cases where realised LGD is calculated at a more aggregated level than single facility level, as described in paragraph 150 above, CCF estimation can be performed at facility level or at the LGD aggregation level. One such example is where CCF is estimated by facility while several facilities are aggregated for LGD purposes, since they are all secured by the same collateral. In this case, institutions should: 
(a) for retail exposures where they use the definition of default at facility level in accordance with the last paragraph of Article 178(1) of the CRR, apply full contagion of default across aggregated facilities; 
(b) ensure consistency between estimation and application of the parameters; 
(c) ensure that no bias results from the aggregation of facilities by validation of the estimates (PD, LGD, CCF) also at the more aggregated level."|232
2269|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 199|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.2 Realised CCFs > 7.2.1 Relevant regulatory references|"199. For the purposes of Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must compute realised CCF. To comply with this requirement, in the understanding of the ECB institutions should adopt the following approach. 
(a) Calculate realised CCF as the ratio of the difference between the EAD and the exposure at the reference date in the numerator, and the difference between the limit at reference date and the exposure at reference date (i.e. the amount available to be drawn at the reference date) in the denominator. This does not mean that, to address the issues with the ""region of instability"", institutions may not use direct EAD realisation (as referred to in paragraph 207(a) of this chapter). In any case, all the requirements regarding CCF risk quantification referred to in the applicable regulation apply, together with the ECB's understanding of those requirements as set out in paragraphs 203, 204, 205, 206 and 210(b) of this chapter. 
(b) Ensure that the definition of exposure is identical to the one used for LGD estimation. In particular, treatment of post-default drawings should be identical for the exposures used in both the LGD and CCF estimations. Discounted additional drawings are expected to be included in CCF when they are included in the LGD denominator. See also paragraph 152(a) above. 
(c) For each reference date and in cases where the same facility defaults more than once during the observation period, consider as the date of default relevant for CCF purposes the date of the first default."|348
2270|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 200|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.3 CCF structure > 7.3.1 Relevant regulatory references|200. A grade or pool is understood by the ECB to be the subset of facilities to which the same CCF is applied for the calculation of regulatory capital requirements, irrespective of how this CCF has been assigned.|69
2271|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 201|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.3 CCF structure > 7.3.1 Relevant regulatory references|"201. To comply with the requirements for the structure of the CCF models established in Article 170 of the CRR, and particularly when considering the risk drivers envisaged by paragraph (4) of that Article, institutions should follow these principles: 
(a) Demonstrate a detailed understanding of the impact on the CCF model of changes in customer product mix or characteristics that take place between reference and default dates and the materiality of that impact. If the impact is material, institutions should address it within their own estimation process. This is because changes in exposure characteristics (e.g. a change in the value of the limit) or ""product profile transformations"" (e.g. a revolving loan that has been converted into a term loan or vice versa) which commonly occur between reference and default dates can impact the CCF model. 
(b) Although the reference date for the calculation of realised CCF should be up to 12 months prior to default, institutions should analyse risk drivers considering information not only at the reference date but also before that date whenever relevant. In assessing whether the use of information from before the reference date is relevant, institutions should take into account the volatility of the risk driver over time. 
(c) Ensure that the models reflect the institution's current policies and strategies regarding account monitoring, including limit monitoring, and payment processing."|293
2272|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 202|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.3 CCF structure > 7.3.1 Relevant regulatory references|202. Where an institution relies on one or more statistical models to define the process of assigning exposures to facility grades or pools (or parts of this process) in accordance with Article 175(4)(b) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that for institutions to comply with the requirement, set out in Article 144(1)(a) of the CRR, that rating systems should provide for a meaningful differentiation of risk as further explained in letters (c) and (e) of Article 30(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/439, the statistical process followed by the institution in selecting its model(s) should include assessing the performance of the model(s) on the basis of independent datasets (data points which were left out of the model fitting) in a way that limits the risk of overfitting. Independent datasets should correspond not only to random sampling (out-of-sample), but also to different time periods (out-of-time) unless there are no sufficient data available for the training sample. The expectations set out above in this paragraph are specifically related to the model development phase. Once the process for assigning exposures to facility grades or pools has been defined, the requirements related to the framework for the review of estimates under paragraphs 217 to 221 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD (which are also relevant for the CCF estimation, according to paragraph 212 of this guide) apply, together with the expectations set out in|329
2273|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 202|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.3 CCF structure > 7.3.1 Relevant regulatory references|Section 9 of this guide. In particular, in accordance with paragraph 218(b)(i) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the institution must carry out an analysis to identify any potential deterioration in the model's performance, including the model's discriminatory power, by comparing its performance at the time of the development with its performance over each subsequent observation period.|100
2274|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 203|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.4 CCF risk quantification > 7.4.1 Relevant regulatory references|203. The exposure value for undrawn commitments is calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF. 95 CCFs can also be derived from direct estimates (for example by modelling total facility EAD) in accordance with Article 169(3) of the CRR. In this case, and in order to comply with Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should also calculate the LRA CCF at a level more granular than calibration segment that is appropriate for the application of the model, namely using individual CCF values if estimation is discrete or sub-ranges of CCF values if estimation is continuous. In addition, institutions should ensure that there are no systematic deviations when comparing the estimated CCFs with the LRA realised CCFs in sub-ranges. In other words, the direction of divergences should be random.|215
2275|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 204|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.4 CCF risk quantification > 7.4.1 Relevant regulatory references|"204. In accordance with Article 182(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions are required to calculate the default weighted LRA CCF separately for each facility grade or pool. To comply with this requirement, institutions should adopt the following approach. 
(a) Ensure that the historical observation period is as broad as possible and contains data from different periods characterised by different economic circumstances, including bad years as reflected in economic indicators that are relevant for the type of exposures considered. 
(b) Calculate the observed average CCF for each facility grade or pool on all defaults observed in the historical observation period. Institutions should apply an appropriate treatment to extremely high values of realised CCF much above 100%, at the level of data quality, risk drivers, assignment to grades or pools or assignment to calibration segments. To ensure that the estimates are accurate, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions are not expected to cap realised CCF values. In other words, they are not expected to replace the observed value by a pre-defined value when the observed value is above the pre-defined one. 
(c) When the historical observation period is considered to be representative of the LRA, the average realised CCFs should be computed as the arithmetic average of the yearly averages of realised CCFs in that period. 
(d) When the historical observation period is not considered to be representative of the LRA: 
(i) if bad years are under-represented in the historical observation period, the observed average CCF should be adjusted upwards in order to estimate an LRA CCF; 
(ii) if bad years are over-represented in the historical observation period, the observed average CCF may be adjusted to estimate an LRA CCF where there is a significant correlation between the economic indicators referred to in paragraph 190(a) and the available observed CCF. 
(e) It is the ECB's understanding that, where CCF estimates for specific facility grades or pools are low or even zero (in exceptional cases) before the MoC is applied, and in order to ensure that these estimates are accurate and not driven by (systematic) errors or distortions, institutions should ensure that their estimation process is pertinent and accurate. In particular, they should ensure that, in these specific facility grades or pools, there is only a very limited number of exposures for which the exposure at the moment of default is higher than the drawn amount at the reference date, and that these outcomes are carefully monitored and scrutinised."|529
2276|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 205|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.4 CCF risk quantification > 7.4.1 Relevant regulatory references|"205. Notwithstanding paragraph 204, for retail exposures an institution need not give equal importance to historical data if more recent data are a better predictor of drawdowns. In the ECB's understanding, an institution may consider that the more recent data are a better predictor of drawdowns and may give more importance to recent historical data if the following apply. 
(a) There is a significant improvement in predictive power when using the more recent data compared with the predictive power resulting from the use of an arithmetic average. This improvement can be evidenced by comparing the estimated CCFs for each grade with the average realised"|149

(b) The oldest data are considered as non-representative as a result of specific policy or business changes in the bank, but not in order to reflect current trends in realised CCFs directly related to macroeconomic conditions. 
(c) The weighting approach is used in a consistent manner over time and any change in the applied weights of historical data is appropriately justified."|125
2278|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 206|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.4 CCF risk quantification > 7.4.1 Relevant regulatory references|206. To comply with the requirements of Article 182(1)(b) and to have CCF estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn, institutions should characterise an economic downturn in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2021/930. To this end, an impact assessment should be performed to identify which identified downturn period is most strongly evidenced by elevated levels of realised CCFs. Any lag between the downturn period and the date of the impact on the realised CCFs should be taken into account. This means that where high levels of realised CCFs are not experienced simultaneously with the downturn periods, but nevertheless result from it, these high CCFs should be considered as the CCFs appropriate for the economic downturn.|181
2279|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 207|CCF modelling|Credit risk > 7 Conversion factors > 7.4 CCF risk quantification > 7.4.1 Relevant regulatory references|"207. In order to ensure a meaningful assessment of transaction characteristics, as required by Article 144(1)(a) of the CRR, particular attention should be given to the following observations. 
(a) A common issue in estimating CCFs concerns facilities close to being fully drawn at the relevant reference date, as a result of the instability that may be observed in the estimates (also known as ""region of instability""). To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that their CCF model is robust and provides estimates that are effectively protected against undesirable issues caused by the ""region of instability"" and/or that their estimates are adjusted adequately. 
(b) Articles 179 and 182 of the CRR lay down the requirements for CCF quantification. In some cases, institutions define CCF values which are mostly based on judgemental considerations. The ECB understands this approach to be compliant with the requirements, provided all the following circumstances are met. 
(i) The exposures to which such CCFs are applied are not material. 
(ii) The data available are scarce to a degree that prevents the institution from obtaining sufficient relevant statistical evidence from them. 
(iii) In accordance with Article 179(1)(a) and 179(1)(f) of the CRR, where data availability is considered to be unsatisfactory, the MoC must be larger, and the less data an institution has, the more conservative its estimation must be. The institution should provide evidence that, in accordance with (a) the internal data available, (b) the contractual terms of the exposures to which the value is applied, and (c) the institution's policies and processes, the CCF value defined is an objectively conservative CCF estimate (in particular, appropriate for an economic downturn and including a sufficient MoC). As a consequence, especially in light of the regulatory requirement of MoC related to data scarcity, a minimum value of 100% must be applied as the final CCF estimate. 
(iv) As part of the framework for the review of estimates of the CCF model, the institution should ensure that the three circumstances set out above continue to be met. With respect to point (iii) above, it should be ensured that the applied values remain conservative over time by comparing them with the realised CCFs of each defaulted facility within the subset of exposures to which such values are applied as a CCF estimate."|514
2280|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 208|Deficiencies and MoC|Credit risk > 8 Model-related MoC > 8.1 Relevant regulatory references|208. Institutions must add to their estimates an MoC that is related to the expected range of estimation errors. 96 To comply with this requirement, institutions are expected to follow paragraphs 36 to 52 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. The ECB understands that the MoC must reflect the uncertainty at the level of the final risk estimates (namely, at the level of the grade or pool). It is also the ECB's understanding that institutions should be able to ensure monotonicity in their final estimates while still reflecting the uncertainty at grade or pool level. In accordance with paragraph 37(a) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, the MoC should consider any deficiencies stemming from missing or inaccurate information including, where relevant and material, any missing or inaccurate climate-related information considered in risk estimates.|185
2281|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 209|Deficiencies and MoC|Credit risk > 8 Model-related MoC > 8.1 Relevant regulatory references|209. Since the MoC requirements laid down by the CRR also apply in cases where institutions estimate CCFs, paragraph 208 is also relevant in such cases.|52
2282|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 210|Deficiencies and MoC|Credit risk > 8 Model-related MoC > 8.1 Relevant regulatory references|"210. In the understanding of the ECB, to reflect the dispersion of the statistical estimators as set out in paragraph 43(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should adopt the following approach. 
(a) For PD, estimate an MoC to account for statistical uncertainty/sampling error affecting the LRA estimate at grade/pool level. This MoC should be based on the distribution of the estimator, which is the average of one-year default rates of the grade/pool across time (i.e. the distribution of (ΣDR$_{t}$) T / ), considering that the uncertainty is primarily driven by the statistical uncertainty of each one-year default rate and the length of the time series. As a result, it is expected that the lower the number of observations per grade and the shorter the time series are, the higher the MoC of the grade should be."|200
2283|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 210|Deficiencies and MoC|Credit risk > 8 Model-related MoC > 8.1 Relevant regulatory references|Institutions need to be aware of and deal adequately with the dependency between default rates over time on the quantification of the MoC, e.g. when using overlapping windows for the calculation of default rates.|57
2284|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 210|Deficiencies and MoC|Credit risk > 8 Model-related MoC > 8.1 Relevant regulatory references|"The above principles also apply for institutions using direct PD estimates and for institutions calibrating the LRA default rate at the level of the calibration segment, as referred to in paragraph 92(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. When using direct PD estimates, the MoC is based on the distribution of this direct PD estimator (which includes the risk differentiation function), implicitly reflecting the uncertainty of the LRA. When calibration is performed at calibration segment level, the general estimation error may be computed at that level when the statistical uncertainty/sampling error is neither significantly different across grades or PD sub-ranges nor significantly different between the calibration segment level and the grades or PD sub-ranges level. 
(b) Similarly, for LGD and CCF, estimate an MoC to account for statistical uncertainty/sampling error affecting the final estimates. This MoC should be defined on the basis of the distribution of the estimators, considering that their uncertainty is primarily driven by the statistical uncertainty of the observations used to compute the long-run and downturn estimates and the length of the time series."|235
2285|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 211|Model application, use, review and changes|Credit risk > 9 Review of estimates > 9.1 Relevant regulatory references|211. Institutions must review their estimates whenever new information comes to light but at least on an annual basis. 97 To comply with this requirement, they are expected to have in place a framework under paragraphs 217 to 221 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.|73
2286|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 212|Model application, use, review and changes|Credit risk > 9 Review of estimates > 9.1 Relevant regulatory references|212. Since the review of estimates requirements under the CRR also apply in cases where an institution estimates CCFs, paragraph 211 is also relevant to such cases.|51
2287|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 213|Model application, use, review and changes|Credit risk > 9 Review of estimates > 9.1 Relevant regulatory references|"213. In the ECB's understanding and for the purposes of paragraph 211, the following principles apply. 
(a) For PD models and regarding the analysis of the predictive power envisaged by paragraph 218(c) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD: 
(i) the analysis should be performed at grade level; for institutions using direct PD estimates, it should be performed at a sufficient level of granularity; 
(ii) institutions should use a range of metrics to assess predictive ability, including statistical tests and graphical analysis of the evolution of default rates and PD. 
(b) The analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(i) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD should also consider, for CCFs, whether including the most recent data leads to a significant change in the LRA CCF or downturn CCF. 
(c) For LGD models that result from a combination of different components (for example, secured and unsecured components), the back-testing analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(ii) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD should be run at both component and facility level. 
(d) In addition, institutions should consider in their frameworks for the review of estimates the availability of data for different exposure types, taking into account the specificities of the model architecture, including the existing and potential risk drivers, under paragraph 220 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. When data are scarce, they should use complementary analyses for those exposure types where quantitative measures prove inconclusive as a result, for example, of the low number of exposures available. 
(e) Where internal data are not considered sufficient to establish fixed targets and tolerances for defined metrics and tools to assess the performance of the PD model in terms of risk differentiation, institutions should define and put in place the appropriate actions to address this. 98 These actions could encompass, for example, the use of complementary analyses for those cases where the results for the application of metrics and tools are proven to be inconclusive. 
(f) When external credit bureau scores or ratings are used as the main (or one of the main) driver(s) of the internal rating, in cases where significant changes are applied to the credit bureau scoring institutions should consider the possibility of adjusting their internal data following the changes applied to the score, and whenever the input variables are no longer considered appropriate in their credit rating process."|502
2288|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 214|Model application, use, review and changes|Credit risk > 9 Review of estimates > 9.1 Relevant regulatory references|214. In the case of material models where the assignment of the grade is based on a statistical model and where there is a risk that slight changes in the ranking of the obligors, or in the boundaries between grades, could lead to significant changes in the RWEA in that portfolio, the framework referred to in paragraph 211 should also include an analysis of whether the inclusion of the most recent data in the RDS used for model development would lead to materially different model outcomes. This analysis should be conducted on a three-yearly basis, or more often, depending on the materiality of the model. The analysis should consider, in particular, whether the discriminatory power of the PD, LGD or CCF models would be materially increased when re-estimating the model parameters on the basis of the updated RDS. Portfolios should be considered as falling into this category when, for example: (i) a limited number of obligors represent an important share of the total exposure; or (ii) exposures are concentrated near the boundaries between two grades.|228
2289|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 215|Model application, use, review and changes|Credit risk > 9 Review of estimates > 9.1 Relevant regulatory references|215. When the number of default observations is low, to analyse whether the main drivers of the observed defaults are appropriately reflected in the model in accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR 99 institutions should analyse individual defaults (or at least a sample of them where the number of defaults makes analysing all of them unduly burdensome). However, the model should not be adapted simply to fit singular events from the institution's file review.|110
2290|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 216|Model application, use, review and changes|Credit risk > 9 Review of estimates > 9.1 Relevant regulatory references|216. In accordance with Article 172(3) of the CRR, for grade and pool assignments institutions must document those situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process. In addition, institutions must complement the statistical model by human judgement and human oversight to review model-based assignments and ensure that the models are used appropriately. 100 Furthermore, review procedures must be designed to find and limit errors associated with model weaknesses. 101 To comply with these requirements, institutions should assess the impact of the application of human judgement on risk differentiation capability (e.g. on discriminatory power), under paragraph 218(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.|154

The purpose of this chapter is to provide transparency on how the ECB understands a number of topics related to internal models used in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. It is important to note that this chapter does not aim to cover exhaustively all topics that could be subject to review during internal model investigations (such as, for example, model governance). The topics covered in the market risk chapter have been selected taking into account the requirements of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and focus on certain modelling aspects relating, for example, to regulatory back-testing of value-at-risk (VaR) models, to VaR and stressed VaR (sVaR) methodologies, and to the incremental default and migration risk charge (IRC) methodology.|163

2298|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 2|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|"2. According to Article 4(1)(86) of the CRR, ""trading book"" means all positions i n financ ial instruments and commodities held by an institution either with trading intent, or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent in accordance with Article 104 of the CRR."|88
2299|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 3|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|"3. In accordance with Article 104 of the CRR, institutions must have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining which positions to include in the trading book for the purpose of calculating their capital requirements (referred to in this guide as the ""regulatory trading book""). The ECB considers that, in this context and in accordance with Article 4(1)(86) of the CRR, ""positions"" refers to positions in financial instruments (as defined in Article 4(1)(50) of the CRR) and commodities, and not to risk positions as referred to in the glossary included in this guide. The ECB understands that positions that are classified as ""held for trading"" for accounting purposes are presumed to be included in the regulatory trading book. Therefore, institutions should be able to list all positions that are classified as ""held for trading"" for accounting purposes but not included in the regulatory trading book, and should be able to justify these exclusions."|219
2300|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 4|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|"4. As the instruments and transactions are included either in the regulatory trading book or in the non-regulatory trading book (referred to in this guide as the ""banking book""), the ECB understands that the policies required by Article 104 of the CRR should also encompass rules for moving instruments between the regulatory trading book and the banking book."|94
2301|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 5|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|5. In order for the ECB to assess the appropriateness and implementation of the policies and procedures for determining which positions to include in the regulatory trading book, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to provide a list of types of positions and instruments allocated to the regulatory trading or the banking book, identify all related transactions including their relevant characteristics, and justify such allocation.|110
2302|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 6|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|"6. In view of their nature in terms of trading intent, the ECB considers that the following types of instruments and transactions are expected to be included in the regulatory trading book: 
(a) instruments in the correlation trading portfolio; 
(b) instruments resulting from securities underwriting commitments; 
(c) instruments held as accounting trading assets or liabilities (""held for trading"" assets and liabilities);$^{5}$ 
(d) instruments resulting from market-making activities;

2304|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 8|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|8. In addition, for each category listed in paragraphs 6 and 7, institutions should be able to indicate to what extent the corresponding positions are included within the scope of the internal model approach (IMA).|67
2305|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 9|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|"9. In accordance with Article 106(1) of the CRR, internal hedges (as defined in Article 4(1)(96) of the CRR) must be properly documented and not be primarily intended to avoid or reduce own funds requirements. Therefore, institutions should be able to identify 9 all internal hedges and should document their treatment for the purpose of calculating own funds requirements for market risk. In accordance with Article 106(1)(d) of the CRR, the market risk that is generated by an internal hedge must be dynamically managed in the regulatory trading book within the authorised limits. For this reason, the ECB considers that proper documentation should distinguish between 
(a) hedges of a banking book credit risk exposure (or counterparty credit risk exposure) using an internal risk transfer with the regulatory trading book; 
(b) hedges of a banking book equity risk exposure using a hedging instrument purchased from the market through the regulatory trading book; 
(c) hedges of a banking book interest rate risk exposure using an internal risk transfer with the regulatory trading book; 
(d) hedges of a banking book foreign exchange risk exposure using an internal risk transfer with the regulatory trading book; 
(e) hedges of a banking book commodity risk exposure using an internal risk transfer with the regulatory trading book; 
(f) eligible hedges (as defined in Article 386(1) of the CRR) that are included in the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) capital charge."|327
2306|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 9|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|Additionally, institutions should be able to identify internal transactions which are in the regulatory trading book 10 and within the scope of the internal model, and show that these transactions do not contribute to the own funds requirements obtained using the internal model.|71
2307|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 10|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|10. In accordance with Article 386(3) of the CRR, eligible CVA hedges that are included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk must not be included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for specific risk of debt instruments. The ECB therefore considers that they should be included in the scope of calculation of own funds requirements for general risk (for example, included in the VaR and sVaR, or treated through the framework for risks-not-in-the-VaR or sVaR engine - see Section 7). Additionally, other (i.e. non-eligible) CVA hedges in the regulatory trading book should be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk (i.e. general and specific risk). The ECB considers that positions entered into with the purpose of hedging CVA risks for counterparties which are exempted from the own funds requirement for CVA risk, in accordance with Article 382(4) of the CRR, should also be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk (i.e. general and specific risk).|251
2308|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 11|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|11. In accordance with Article 362 of the CRR, position risk on a traded debt instrument may be divided into two components: specific risk and general risk. In accordance with the same article, general risk of traded debt instruments refers to the risk of a price change due to a change in the level of interest rates. The ECB considers that this is a reference to risk-free interest rates and does not include counterparty credit spread risk (i.e. the risk of a price change due to a change in the credit spread of the counterparty to a transaction). In accordance with the same article, specific risk of debt instruments refers to the risk of a price change due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The ECB considers that this definition of specific risk does not include counterparty credit spread risk. Consistent with this interpretation, the ECB considers that counterparty credit spread risk does not fall under the definition of either general or specific risk, cannot be included in the scope of the IMA and is not part of the actual or hypothetical profit and loss (P&L) for back-testing.|258
2309|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 12|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|12. Back-to-back transactions in the regulatory trading book (i.e. transactions exactly matched with a third-party transaction) are generally included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. The ECB considers that back-to-back transactions included in the scope of the internal model may be excluded from the calculation of own funds requirements, provided that institutions are able to document them and demonstrate that there are no residual market risks stemming from these transactions. However, potential P&L generated by these back-to-back transactions should be considered in the back-testing (for those P&L components that are not excluded from the actual or hypothetical P&L). This is because, although they do not carry residual market risks, such back-to-back transactions could generate P&L (for example, at the inception of the trade, or where the transaction is closed before maturity).|195
2310|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 13|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.2 Delimitation of the regulatory trading book|13. The ECB understands that instruments in the regulatory trading book which are lent out or repoed out should be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. Conversely, instruments borrowed/obtained via securities lending or reverse repo should not be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. This is because the securities lending or repo transaction does not transfer the market risk of the security. Furthermore, the market risk of the securities lending or repo transaction should be captured (if this transaction is recorded in the trading book).|133
2311|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 14|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.3 Treatment of banking book positions|14. In accordance with Article 92(4)(a) of the CRR, for foreign exchange (FX) risk and commodities risk the own funds requirements must include those arising from all the business activities of an institution. Therefore, the ECB understands that for FX risk and commodities risk, the requirements for the calculation of own funds and, in particular, the IMA are not limited only to regulatory trading book positions but also include the positions in the banking book.|115
2312|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 15|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.3 Treatment of banking book positions|15. For institutions that have approval to use the IMA for FX risk, the ECB is aware that the modelling of banking book FX positions in the internal model may be challenging owing to different trade booking systems and different market data processes for the banking book and for the regulatory trading book. In accordance with Article 363(2) of the CRR, permission to use internal models for market risk will be granted only if the internal model covers a significant share of the positions of a certain risk category. 11 Therefore, institutions may exclude banking book FX positions from the scope of the internal model, provided that they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the ECB that the scope of the approved internal model nevertheless covers a significant share of the positions of the FX risk category. If that is the case, the banking book FX exclusions should be treated in the same way as those positions excluded from the regulatory trading book (see Section 2.5).|210
2313|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 16|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.3 Treatment of banking book positions|16. In accordance with Article 92(3)(c) of the CRR, the own funds requirements for foreign exchange risk must be determined in accordance with the CRR provisions for market risk (using either the standardised approach or the IMA). Therefore, where excluded from the internal model, the banking book FX positions must be subject to own funds requirements calculated according to the standardised approach. The ECB considers a prudent approach to be that for the purpose of this own funds requirement calculation, banking book FX positions are not netted with regulatory trading book FX positions.|136
2314|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 17|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.3 Treatment of banking book positions|17. In accordance with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions must have established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of their internal models. To satisfy the requirements of Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions should have documented processes and methodologies in place for determining FX positions. The ECB considers that in order to adequately cover the overall operation of the internal model, such documentation should include, in particular, the intermediate steps followed for calculating the FX positions, beginning with each individual subsidiary and proceeding to the group level (for example, before and after netting, the treatment of intragroup deals, the methodology applied to derive the FX position of banking book items including whether the institution applies the provisions of Article 352(3) of the CRR).|195
2315|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 17|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.3 Treatment of banking book positions|If an institution excludes any balance sheet items denominated in foreign currency from the FX positions in accordance with the provisions of Article 352(2) of the CRR, it should document in detail which positions are covered by the exclusion - including details on the materiality of each of them and the justification for the exclusion, so that the institution can demonstrate that the provisions of the article have been complied with. In particular, this also applies at the consolidated and sub-consolidated levels to balance sheet items in foreign currencies that stem from consolidated subsidiaries and is without prejudice to the extent and manner of prudential consolidation prescribed in Article 18 of the CRR.|153
2316|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 18|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.3 Treatment of banking book positions|18. In order for the ECB to assess whether banking book FX positions have been excluded from the scope of application of the IMA for the sole purpose of reducing the own funds requirements for market risk, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require an institution to estimate the difference between the own funds requirements calculated under the standardised approach and the own funds requirements calculated under the IMA 12 for those banking book FX positions.$^{13}$|119
2317|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 19|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.3 Treatment of banking book positions|19. The ECB is aware that (in contrast to FX positions) it is not common practice to include commodities positions in the banking book. However, where an institution has permission to use the internal model for commodities risk, commodities positions in the banking book should not be systematically excluded from the scope of application of the internal model.|87
2318|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 20|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.4 Partial use models|"20. If an institution does not have permission to use an internal model to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk for all of the six risk categories listed in Article 363(1) of the CRR, but only for some of them (for the purposes of this guide, referred to as ""partial use""), the institution must apply the standardised approach in accordance with Article 363(2) of the CRR to calculate the own funds requirements for the risk categories for which it has not been granted permission."|124
2319|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 21|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.4 Partial use models|21. In the case of portfolios for which the bulk of the risks fall outside the scope of the approved risk categories of an internal model, 14 institutions may completely carve out such portfolios from the scope of application of the internal model, provided that the internal model still covers a significant share of the relevant risk categories. The ECB considers it best practice to carve out such portfolios only if the overall own funds requirements for market risk after the carve-out are higher than they would have been if the carve-out had not been performed.|124
2320|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 21|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.4 Partial use models|Institutions should duly notify the ECB of such exclusions in accordance with the Commission Delegated Regulation on materiality of extensions and changes of the IMA. Institutions should, nevertheless, ensure that the risks of these portfolios are adequately managed. Institutions should determine the own funds requirements for the carved-out portfolios according to the standardised approach (for all risk categories, including those for which the institution has permission to use the internal model).|104
2321|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 22|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.4 Partial use models|22. Portfolios for which the bulk of the risks fall within the scope of the model approval should be included in the calculation of own funds requirements using the internal model (for the risk categories within the scope of the internal model permission). The own funds requirements for the risks not included in the scope of the internal model permission should be determined according to the standardised approach.|94
2322|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 23|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.4 Partial use models|23. In accordance with Article 362 of the CRR, general risk of debt instruments refers to the risk of a price change due to a change in the level of interest rates. The ECB considers that this is a reference to risk-free interest rates. In accordance with Article 362 of the CRR, general risk of equity instruments refers to the risk of a price change due to a change of a broad equity-market movement unrelated to any specific attributes of individual securities. The ECB considers that this is a reference to index movements. An institution without permission to use the IMA for the specific risk of debt or equity instruments, and which applies a different definition of general risk of debt or equity instruments (as applicable) should be able to demonstrate that the definition/s it applies lead to at least the same level of own funds requirements that would result from applying the principles of this paragraph.|196
2323|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 24|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.5 Exclusion of positions in the regulatory trading book from the scope of application of the IMA|24. In accordance with Article 363(2) of the CRR, an internal model must cover a significant share of the positions of each risk category for which the permission is granted. The ECB understands that this requirement applies not only on the date on which the permission is granted, but on an ongoing basis. The ECB is aware that institutions have a certain margin of discretion not to include all positions exposed to the relevant approved risk categories, provided that the internal model still covers a significant share of those positions. In the ECB's view, exclusions would be justified where the inclusion of those positions in the internal model is operationally challenging (for example, in the case of products requiring a more sophisticated modelling approach). Exclusions should never be made for the sole purpose of reducing the overall own funds requirements for market risk.|199
2324|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 24|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.5 Exclusion of positions in the regulatory trading book from the scope of application of the IMA|"The ECB considers that to be able to demonstrate that the internal model covers a significant share of positions, institutions should monitor the exclusion of market risk positions, including the materiality of those positions. In the case of FX and commodities risks, this monitoring should also extend to exclusions of banking book positions. This monitoring should consider all excluded positions in accordance with each relevant scope of approval of the internal model, which could be at individual (""solo""), sub-consolidated, or consolidated level. Institutions should be able to justify such exclusions and demonstrate that the risk of the excluded positions is adequately managed."|154
2325|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 25|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.5 Exclusion of positions in the regulatory trading book from the scope of application of the IMA|25. The own funds requirements for the positions deliberately excluded by the institution from the internal model (including any banking book positions) should be determined according to the standardised approach. For these positions, institutions should be able to demonstrate that the level of own funds requirements under the standardised approach is commensurate with their risks and that the exclusion was not made for the sole purpose of reducing the overall own funds requirements for market risk.$^{15}$|124
2326|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 26|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.5 Exclusion of positions in the regulatory trading book from the scope of application of the IMA|"26. The ECB considers that an appropriate approach to calculating the own funds requirements for derivatives on unusual underlyings (such as temperature, weather or mortality) 16 could be to include them in the scope of the IMA (the ""exotic"" risks might be treated under the risks-not-in-the-model-engines (RNIME)$^{17}$"" framework, where necessary). However, institutions may use the standardised approach for these positions, provided that they can demonstrate that the level of own funds requirements under the standardised approach is commensurate with the risks of such positions."|153
2327|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 27|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.5 Exclusion of positions in the regulatory trading book from the scope of application of the IMA|27. The ECB considers that a materiality criterion at transaction level (for example, a notional amount lower than a certain EUR amount) is not an appropriate criterion by itself for an exclusion from the scope, because the cumulative effect of these transactions may be a material position. Therefore, this type of exclusion should not be applied.|101
2328|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 28|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.5 Exclusion of positions in the regulatory trading book from the scope of application of the IMA|28. If back-to-back transactions are excluded from the calculation of own funds requirements using the internal model (in the circumstances set out in paragraph 12), it is not necessary - as it is with other excluded positions - to calculate the own funds requirements for these transactions under the standardised approach, as no residual market risks stem from them.|103
2329|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 29|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.1 Own-debt exposures|"29. For the purposes of this guide, the meaning of ""own debt"" requires clarification, given that the CRR does not provide a definition. As defined in Article 4(1)(47) of the CRR, ""consolidated situation"" means the situation that results from applying the requirements of the CRR to an institution as if that institution formed, together with one or more other entities, a single institution. As defined in Article 4(1)(49) of the CRR, ""sub-consolidated basis"" means ""… on the basis of the consolidated situation of a parent entity … that is not the ultimate parent entity"". Therefore, the ECB considers an acceptable approach to be that when determining their own-debt positions, institutions using an IRC model also take into account the debt positions in their subsidiaries within the scope of prudential consolidation, depending on the level within the group of the institution using the IRC model."|222
2330|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 30|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.1 Own-debt exposures|30. By way of illustration, the positions described in the following situations can be considered as own-debt exposures. Figures 1, 2 and 3 below each illustrate an example, as indicated.|73

2338|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 31|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.1 Own-debt exposures|31. Under paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 of the EBA Guidelines on the IRC, for long or short positions in an institution's own debt which may arise from trading or market-making activity in its own-debt issuances, or from trading protection in the institution's own name (for example, via an index), the institution should only model the migration risk. The default risk of these positions should not be modelled in the IRC approach.|125
2339|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 31|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.1 Own-debt exposures|To ensure consistency with the IRC model when modelling the specific risk of debt instruments in the VaR and sVaR models, institutions should include their own creditworthiness. 18 The ECB considers it best practice to model such own creditworthiness as (a) separate risk factor(s) in the VaR and sVaR models. 19 In addition, in accordance with Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, the model must accurately capture all material price risks. Therefore, the ECB understands that the funding risk embedded in own liabilities held in the trading book should be modelled in the IMA.|157
2340|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 32|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.1 Own-debt exposures|32. As regards the general risk of debt instruments for own debt, and in the absence of any specific provision in the CRR or the EBA Guidelines on the IRC, the ECB understands that the general risk of own-debt instruments should be accommodated in the internal model if the institution has the relevant approval.|95
2341|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 33|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.2 Positions in defaulted debt|"33. Under paragraph 4.5 of the EBA Guidelines on the IRC, institutions should include in the calculation of the IRC the positions in defaulted debt that are held in the regulatory trading book, where material. In order for the ECB to assess the appropriateness of the treatment of such positions, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to provide a list of all positions in defaulted debt that are held in the regulatory trading book, along with the following information: 
(a) the market value of the exposure; 
(b) notional value of the exposure; 
(c) a Boolean variable indicating whether the positions are included in the VaR/sVaR; 
(d) a Boolean variable indicating whether the positions are included in the IRC."|193
2342|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 34|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.2 Positions in defaulted debt|34. The ECB considers that to reflect paragraph 4.5 of the EBA Guidelines on the IRC, material positions in defaulted debt should be included in the scope of the IMA. It also considers it best practice that non-material positions are included in the IMA; either in the VaR, sVaR (and IRC) engines or under the RNIME framework for the VaR, sVaR (and IRC).|119
2343|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 35|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.2 Positions in defaulted debt|35. Under paragraph 4.5 of the EBA Guidelines on the IRC, positions in defaulted debt held in the regulatory trading book should, where material, be included in the calculation of the IRC. In accordance with the requirement in Article 372(d) of the CRR as it relates to Article 370(e), the IRC model must be sensitive to material idiosyncratic differences between similar but not identical positions. Therefore, the ECB considers that when modelling the risk of price changes of positions in defaulted debt in the IRC, and to account for those idiosyncratic differences, institutions should apply a specific calibration of the recovery rates which is appropriate for the positions in defaulted debt. If an institution does not have the capacity to model price changes of positions in defaulted debt in the IRC model (for example, owing to IT constraints), the ECB considers that an appropriate way to account for those differences is to apply a stressed price of the positions in defaulted debt that is proven to be adequately conservative given the quantile and holding period of the IRC.|244
2344|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 36|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.2 Positions in defaulted debt|36. The ECB considers that default should be an absorbing state (i.e. once a position has defaulted it does not migrate to a different state). Therefore, the ECB considers it best practice that no migration from default to non-default states is considered in the IRC model.|86
2345|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 37|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.3 Collective investment undertakings|"37. This paragraph, and the following paragraphs 38 to 43 inclusive, apply to all exposures that institutions may have in collective investment undertakings (CIUs), as referred to in Article 4(1)(7) of the CRR (including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), equity investments in hedge funds, etc.) - which for the purposes of these paragraphs are referred to as ""positions in CIUs"" - and also apply to derivative instruments that have these instruments as underlying assets."|134
2346|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 38|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.3 Collective investment undertakings|"38. In accordance with Articles 368(1)(e) and 103(1) of the CRR, institutions must have established procedures for ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of their internal models and the regulatory trading book. Therefore, the ECB considers that in order to ensure that an appropriate treatment is applied to positions in CIUs in their internal models for market risk, institutions should have a documented set of policies and controls in place to identify, for each CIU, the following: 
(a) the risk categories, as listed in Article 363 of the CRR, to which the CIU is subject; 
(b) whether the criteria as defined in Article 349 of the CRR are fulfilled; 
(c) whether daily look-through is possible, as referred to in Article 350(1) of the CRR; 
(d) where daily look-through is not possible, whether the requirements as laid down in Article 350(2) of the CRR are satisfied - in particular, institutions should define and document the methodology used to assess the correlation between the CIU and the index/basket that it tracks; 
(e) the extent to which the CIU can be marked-to-market daily by reference to an active, liquid two-way market as referred to in Article 103(1) of the CRR (for example, whether a daily liquid price is available)."|321
2347|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 39|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.3 Collective investment undertakings|39. The above information in relation to each CIU should be documented. In the ECB's view it is necessary to update the information regularly, in order to ensure that the documented information is based on the current characteristics of the positions in CIUs and fully reflects the market risk to which the positions are exposed. The ECB considers that an appropriate update frequency for existing positions in CIUs is at least annual, as one year is a reasonable time in which significant changes in the market or in the positions in CIUs could occur. In addition, this time frame would allow institutions to use the outcomes of the updates in the review of their overall risk management process, as referred to in Article 368(2) of the CRR. For new positions in CIUs, the ECB considers that the procedure should take place before the investment in a new CIU is approved internally, in order to ensure that institutions compute own funds requirements for the positions in CIUs in compliance with the CRR requirements.|231
2348|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 40|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.3 Collective investment undertakings|40. For the foreign exchange market risk related to CIUs, the CRR contemplates a specific treatment. In accordance with Article 367(2)(b) of the CRR, the actual foreign exchange positions of a CIU must be taken into account in the internal model. Institutions may rely on third-party reporting of the foreign exchange positions of a CIU where the correctness of that reporting is adequately ensured. If an institution is not aware of the foreign exchange positions of a|129
2349|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 40|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.3 Collective investment undertakings|CIU, this position must be carved out and treated in accordance with Article 353(3) of the CRR.|57
2350|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 41|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.3 Collective investment undertakings|41. As regards general and specific risk of equity instruments, general and specific risk of debt instruments, and commodities risk: for those positions in CIUs for which the conditions for either the look-through approach (as referred to in Article 350(1) of the CRR) or the representation approach (as referred to in Article 350(2) of the CRR) are met, the ECB considers that in order to ensure an accurate risk measurement, the own funds requirements for the general and specific risk of equity instruments, the general and specific risk of debt instruments and the commodities risk should be calculated by incorporating the underlying investments of the relevant CIU - or the index/basket that it tracks into the internal model for the risk categories for which the institution has permission to use internal models.|192
2351|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 41|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.3 Collective investment undertakings|Where an institution with internal model approval for specific risk of debt instruments includes listed equity positions in the IRC, it should be consistent in including in the IRC either the underlying listed equity positions of the CIU, or those of the index/basket that the CIU tracks.|86
2352|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 42|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.3 Collective investment undertakings|"42. For positions in CIUs where neither the conditions for the look-through approach as referred to in Article 350(1) of the CRR nor the conditions for the representation approach as referred to in Article 350(2) of the CRR are met, the following apply. 
(a) In accordance with Article 364(2)(a) of the CRR, institutions using an internal model to calculate their own funds requirements for specific risk of debt instruments must fulfil an additional own funds requirement for specific risk of debt instruments in accordance with the standardised approach for positions in CIUs under Articles 348 to 350 of the CRR. 
(b) The ECB considers that the positions in CIUs can be incorporated into the VaR and sVaR models as a single risk factor to account for the general and specific risk of equity, the general risk of debt instruments, and the commodities risk of the positions in CIUs. As is the case for any other position, sufficient objective information on market risk should be available. The ECB considers that a suitable approach is to use the daily liquid price of the CIU."|260
2353|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 43|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.6 Treatment of specific positions > 2.6.3 Collective investment undertakings|43. For those risk categories in respect of which the institution does not use an internal model to compute own funds requirements for market risk, or for positions in CIUs to which none of the above-mentioned provisions apply, the institution should compute the own funds requirements for the respective positions in CIUs according to the standardised approach for CIUs.|102
2354|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 44|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.7 Aggregation requirements|44. In accordance with Article 363 of the CRR, competent authorities may grant permission to institutions to calculate their own funds requirements for market risk by using their internal models instead of, or in combination with, the standardised approach - provided that the internal model covers a significant share of the positions of a certain risk category. For example, in accordance with Articles 6(1) and 11(1) of the CRR, institutions must meet their own funds requirements on an individual basis (unless, for example, a derogation in the circumstances set out in Article 7 of the CRR has been granted), and the parent institution in a Member State must comply with the own funds requirements on a consolidated basis.|165
2355|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 44|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.7 Aggregation requirements|"Therefore, the institution at the highest level of consolidation operating within the framework of the Single Supervisory Mechanism should be able to specify: 
(a) which legal entities within the group have been granted permission to use an internal model for calculating own funds requirements for market risk; 
(b) the scope of application of each model permission (i.e. individual, subconsolidated or consolidated); 
(c) the risk categories listed in Article 363(1) of the CRR for which each permission has been granted."|123
2356|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 44|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.7 Aggregation requirements|The ECB also understands that, for institutions to calculate own funds requirements at the consolidated level by using their internal models, a permission to use their internal models at consolidated level is required under Article 363(2) of the CRR.|66
2357|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 45|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.7 Aggregation requirements|45. In those cases in which the scope of the permission applies at the consolidated or sub-consolidated level, institutions should be able to provide a list of legal entities included in the scope of consolidation or sub-consolidation, specifying which of those entities effectively contribute to the market risk own funds requirements determined by using the internal model. In order for the ECB to assess how the own funds requirements are determined, institutions should also be able to provide information on how each legal entity is integrated into the information system infrastructure of the risk management system and whether impediments exist to such integration.|136
2358|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 45|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.7 Aggregation requirements|If impediments exist to the integration of the risk numbers from individual legal entities, the ECB considers it best practice to integrate the risk numbers from these entities into the model-based own funds requirements by applying a simple sum aggregation.|63
2359|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 46|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.7 Aggregation requirements|46. In accordance with Article 368(1)(a) of the CRR, the internal model must be closely integrated into the daily risk management process of the institution and serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management. Therefore, the ECB understands that institutions should ensure an integrated and harmonised risk management across all legal entities included in the scope of the model permission.|96
2360|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 47|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.7 Aggregation requirements|47. In accordance with Article 325b of the CRR, institutions may use positions in one institution or undertaking to offset positions in another institution or undertaking only for the purpose of calculating net positions and own funds requirements for market risk on a consolidated basis, and only subject to the permission of the competent authorities. The ECB understands that this requirement applies to all positions, in particular to intragroup transactions.$^{20}$ The offsetting of positions can be performed irrespective of the calculation approach that is applied for market risk own funds requirements (i.e. IMA or standardised approach). In order for the ECB to assess how these requirements are fulfilled, institutions should document how the offsetting of positions is performed.|162
2361|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 48|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.7 Aggregation requirements|48. In accordance with Article 367(3) of the CRR, an institution may use empirical correlations within risk categories and across risk categories only if the institution's approach to measuring correlations is sound and implemented with integrity. The ECB understands that for empirical correlations to be sound they should be based on reliable and objective data. If this cannot be ensured, an institution should use the simple sum aggregation of stand-alone risk numbers within risk categories or across risk categories.|112
2362|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 48|Other|Market risk > 2 Scope of the internal model approach > 2.7 Aggregation requirements|In order for the ECB to assess the soundness and integrity of the implementation of the use of empirical correlations, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to provide the standalone VaR and sVaR corresponding to each of the following risk classes:$^{21}$ interest rate risk; equity risk; commodity risk; foreign exchange risk; and credit spread risk.|101
2363|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 48|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.1 Regulatory references|Once adopted by the European Commission, the Final draft RTS on assessment methodology for IMA and significant share will become an additional relevant regulatory reference. Currently that document only exists in a final draft version.|58
2364|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 49|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.2 Scope of application of regulatory back-testing|49. The scope of application of regulatory back-testing, as referred to in Article 366 of the CRR, should be clearly documented.|53
2365|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 50|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.2 Scope of application of regulatory back-testing|"50. In accordance with Article 366(3) of the CRR, regulatory back-testing compares the hypothetical and actual changes in the portfolio's value (""hypothetical P&L"" and ""actual P&L"") with the related one-day VaR number generated by the institution's model. Therefore, the changes in value of all of (and only) the instruments and transactions entailing positions included in the scope of calculation of the VaR model should be considered in the calculation of the hypothetical P&L and the actual P&L."|135
2366|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 51|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.2 Scope of application of regulatory back-testing|51. In particular, if the institution is authorised to apply the IMA for foreign exchange and/or commodities risk positions, and the banking book positions in these risk categories are included in the scope of the internal model, the institution should include these banking book positions in the back-testing and should clearly document how the actual and the hypothetical P&L of these positions are calculated.|99
2367|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 52|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.2 Scope of application of regulatory back-testing|52. Regarding positions in the banking book that are included in the IMA, only the changes in value of market data pertaining to FX risk and commodity risk should be taken into account in the calculation of the actual and the hypothetical P&L. Only for those instruments or transactions where the separation of the positions stemming from risk categories other than FX risk or commodities risk (for example, risk of debt instruments) is operationally challenging or its effect on the total P&L is immaterial, an institution may include changes in value of market parameters pertaining to all risk categories in the actual and the hypothetical P&L. Institutions should be able to justify the immateriality or the operational challenge, if applicable. In particular, considering only the effect of FX risk in the actual and the hypothetical P&L is not deemed to be operationally challenging.|194
2368|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 53|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.2 Scope of application of regulatory back-testing|53. Positions excluded from the calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk on the basis of a permission granted by the competent authorities under Article 352(2) of the CRR (i.e. (i) positions taken in order to hedge against the adverse effect of the exchange rate on the institution's capital ratios, or (ii) positions which an institution has which relate to items that are already deducted in the calculation of own funds) should also be excluded from the scope of application of the back-testing.|128
2369|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 54|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.2 Scope of application of regulatory back-testing|54. In accordance with Article 386(3) of the CRR, eligible hedges that are included in the calculation of own funds requirements for CVA risk must not be included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for specific risk. Therefore, the change in value of those positions that are attributable to specific risk of those eligible hedges should also be excluded from the actual and the hypothetical P&L. However, if the own funds requirements for general risk of these eligible hedges are calculated using the VaR model (see paragraph 10), the change in value of those positions that are attributable to general risk should be included in the actual and in the hypothetical P&L.|163
2370|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 55|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.2 Scope of application of regulatory back-testing|55. Hedges which under Article 386(3) of the CRR are not eligible hedges for regulatory CVA should be included in the VaR calculation and in the scope of calculation of the hypothetical P&L and the actual P&L for back-testing.|80
2371|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 56|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.3 Historical period used to perform back-testing, definition of business days, and documentation|56. In accordance with Article 366(2) of the CRR, the addend to the multiplication factors must depend on the number of overshootings for the most recent 250 business days.|74
2372|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 57|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.3 Historical period used to perform back-testing, definition of business days, and documentation|57. For the purpose of paragraph 56, institutions should define and document local and global business days according to the guidance set out in paragraphs 58 to 60.|67
2373|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 58|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.3 Historical period used to perform back-testing, definition of business days, and documentation|58. The ECB considers that when the business trading unit of an institution is conducting planned business operations on the risk positions (even with a reduced number of staff) on a given day in a given location, this constitutes a local business day for the institution in that location. Therefore, as it is a business day, it requires actual and hypothetical P&L calculation, VaR calculation and market risk monitoring and reporting. Institutions should consistently define their business days, and therefore should be able to justify any non-business days. Unchanged risk positions are a necessary but not sufficient condition to demonstrate adequately that a particular day constitutes a non-business day.|160
2374|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 59|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.3 Historical period used to perform back-testing, definition of business days, and documentation|"59. The ECB considers that global business days should be defined at the consolidated level (or for a national sub-group, at the sub-consolidated level), and that for the purpose of defining global business days the institution's most important trading location (the ""reference location"") should be used, to ensure that the most important trading activity is adequately captured in back-testing. Global business days should include at least the local business days of the reference location. If there are two or more important trading locations (of approximately the same size), the institution should choose one reference location and is allowed to add additional global business days based on the local business days of the other important trading locations. In such a case, the rationale underlying this choice should be documented."|182
2375|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 60|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.3 Historical period used to perform back-testing, definition of business days, and documentation|60. For every global business day, actual and hypothetical P&L calculation, VaR calculation and market risk monitoring and reporting are required. 22 However, if such calculations are carried out on non-global business days, these should not be used for the purpose of regulatory back-testing. The actual and hypothetical P&L used for back-testing should always be the P&L between two consecutive global business days, and should be compared with the related one-day VaR forecast for a one-day holding period between those two global business days, and be based on the composition of the portfolio on the first of those global business days.|158
2376|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 61|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.3 Historical period used to perform back-testing, definition of business days, and documentation|"61. Based on Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, the ECB understands that institutions should have a documented policy and procedure describing how they calculate the actual and hypothetical P&L. The ECB considers that to be fit for purpose, the policy and procedure should include, at least, the following key information: 
(a) how the actual P&L is calculated and, in particular, the differences between the economic 23 and actual P&L; 
(b) the fees, commissions and net interest income excluded from the actual P&L; 
(c) how the hypothetical P&L is calculated and, in particular, the differences between the actual and hypothetical P&L; 
(d) the valuation adjustments not updated every day and whether or not they are included in the P&L time series."|199
2377|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 61|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.3 Historical period used to perform back-testing, definition of business days, and documentation|In order for the ECB to assess the appropriateness and implementation of the policy and procedure for the calculation of the actual and hypothetical P&L, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to provide, for a sample of transactions or portfolios, detailed decompositions of economic, actual and hypothetical P&L into their elements.|108
2378|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 62|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.1 General rules|62. In accordance with Article 366(3) of the CRR, actual P&L must be based on actual changes in the portfolio's end-of-day value. Therefore, the ECB understands that the actual P&L should correspond closely to the daily economic P&L as reflected in the books and records of the institution, with the exception of certain elements as specified in the following paragraphs.|113
2379|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 63|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.1 General rules|63. Actual P&L should include the profit and loss stemming from intraday activities, as they change the portfolio's value. In accordance with Article 366(3) of the CRR, fees, commissions and net interest income must be excluded from the actual P&L. The definitions and methods used to apply this exclusion should be clearly documented.|104
2380|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 64|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.1 General rules|64. In accordance with Article 366(3) of the CRR, fees, commissions and net interest income must be excluded from the portfolio's actual value when computing the actual P&L. The ECB understands that these exclusions from the portfolio's actual end-of-day value are required by the CRR so that fees, commissions, and interest gains or losses are removed from the daily actual P&L in order to ensure that the back-testing assesses whether P&L fluctuations driven by market risk are accurately captured by the VaR model. Furthermore, the ECB acknowledges that the net interest income definition applied to banking book items accounted for at amortised cost cannot easily be transferred to the fair value items in the regulatory trading book.|180
2381|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 64|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.1 General rules|The ECB considers that it is acceptable for an institution to define the net interest income in the regulatory trading book as equal to zero; this leads to no P&L component being excluded as net interest income.|73
2382|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 64|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.1 General rules|The ECB considers that where an institution uses another definition for net interest income it should be able to duly justify this approach, taking into account its trading strategy. In any case, theta effects (for example, options theta) and P&L contributions of unearned credit spreads should not contribute to the net interest income, because they are susceptible to market risk.|103
2383|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 65|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.1 General rules|65. The actual P&L is calculated for instruments and transactions entailing positions 24 in the regulatory trading book and banking book which are within the scope of the IMA. In accordance with Article 366(3) of the CRR, the actual P&L must be based on the actual value at the end of the subsequent day. Therefore, the ECB considers that the change in value of all market risk parameters (even those that are not modelled in the VaR) should be taken into account in the actual P&L.|143
2384|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 66|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.1 General rules|66. In order to ensure that the actual P&L corresponds closely to the daily economic P&L as reflected in the books and records of the institution, the ECB considers that the pricing methods, model parametrisations and market data should be the same as those used to compute the daily economic P&L.|97
2385|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 67|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.2 Valuation adjustments|67. Because the actual P&L should correspond closely to the daily economic P&L as reflected in the books and records of the institution, all valuation adjustments or reserves made in the economic P&L are also relevant for the calculation of the actual P&L. Therefore, institutions should clearly document all such valuation adjustments and reserves (methodology, frequencies, calculation process, etc.).|111
2386|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 68|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.2 Valuation adjustments|"68. Except for the elements referred to in paragraphs 69 to 71 below, fair value adjustments 25 and all other valuation adjustments or reserves (hereinafter referred to as ""adjustments"") made in the economic P&L should be included in the actual P&L even if they are not computed on a daily basis - provided that they are in the scope of market risk."|112
2387|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 69|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.2 Valuation adjustments|69. The ECB considers that credit valuation adjustments (CVA) should be excluded from the actual P&L, 26 because they receive a specific regulatory treatment. The same applies to debit valuation adjustments (DVA), due to their nature as the reverse side of CVA.|90
2388|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 70|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.2 Valuation adjustments|70. Additional valuation adjustments (AVA) 27 that are calculated to obtain the prudent value of the positions in the regulatory trading book should also be excluded from the actual P&L, as they receive a specific regulatory treatment under Article 34 of the CRR as an additional layer of prudence.|94
2389|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 71|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.2 Valuation adjustments|71. Changes in portfolio value generated by the default of a counterparty should be excluded from the actual P&L, provided that the institution demonstrates that they are related solely to counterparty credit risk; this is because the corresponding profits or losses are taken into account in the institution's counterparty credit risk framework. Conversely, profits or losses due to the default of a bond or other fixed income security are not in the scope of counterparty credit risk and should therefore be included in the actual P&L.|135
2390|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 72|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.4 Calculation of actual P&L > 3.4.2 Valuation adjustments|72. In accordance with Article 366(3) of the CRR, back-testing must be performed daily on the portfolio's end-of-day value. It could therefore be understood that changes in valuation adjustment figures should be computed daily to obtain an accurate portfolio end-of-day value. However, the ECB is aware that some valuation adjustments are not calculated daily by some institutions. In such cases, the ECB considers that changes in valuation adjustment figures should be taken into account in the actual P&L on the business day which is taken as the reference date for the calculation of the valuation adjustment. As a consequence, institutions should not apply any kind of smoothing or distribution over several dates in relation to changes in valuation adjustment figures.|177
2391|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 73|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.5 Calculation of hypothetical P&L|"73. In accordance with Article 366(3) of the CRR, the hypothetical P&L is based on changes in the portfolio's value assuming unchanged positions at the end of the subsequent day. The ECB understands that the term ""unchanged positions"" refers to an unchanged composition of the portfolio in terms of instruments and transactions. Therefore, the P&L generated by intraday trading and by new transactions entered (or maturing transactions) during the day is not taken into account. The ECB understands that the term ""subsequent day"" could imply a passage of time of one business day and that this could lead to a change in the risk positions due solely to this passage of time. Therefore, institutions may choose to include the passage of time of one business day in the hypothetical P&L."|185
2392|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 73|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.5 Calculation of hypothetical P&L|"The ECB understands from Article 366(3) of the CRR that back-testing on the hypothetical P&L is intended to focus on detecting deficiencies in the internal model. Therefore, back-testing on hypothetical P&L should be used as a statistical test of the integrity of the VaR measure, allowing for a more ""pure"" testing of the model.$^{28}$"|98
2393|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 74|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.5 Calculation of hypothetical P&L|74. In accordance with Article 366(3) of the CRR, the hypothetical P&L is to be based on the portfolio's value, assuming unchanged positions, while the actual P&L is to be based on the portfolio's actual value. Therefore, the ECB considers that any adjustments taken into account in order to obtain the actual value of the portfolio should not be considered in the hypothetical P&L, unless they are part of the VaR model. 29 Consequently, any other profit and loss element such as credit valuation adjustments (CVA), debit valuation adjustments (DVA), additional valuation adjustments (AVA) and any other valuation adjustments as well as fees, commissions and net interest income, should not be included in the hypothetical P&L.$^{30}$|180
2394|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 75|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.5 Calculation of hypothetical P&L|75. As both the actual and the hypothetical P&L are based on the portfolio's value, they should be calculated using the same pricing framework. Therefore, the hypothetical P&L should be computed using the same pricing methods, model parametrisations and market data as those used to compute the daily economic P&L. Where an institution computes the hypothetical P&L in a system that is different from the one that is used to produce the daily economic P&L, the risk is that differences in the computations could occur. To minimise this risk, the institution should ensure that differences in market value computations at instrument or transaction level and at the total hypothetical P&L level are negligible, and should monitor the alignment frequently.|170
2395|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 76|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.5 Calculation of hypothetical P&L|76. The back-testing on the hypothetical P&L should be used as a statistical test of the integrity of the VaR measure. Therefore, paragraph 75 applies to partial use models so that only the changes in market value due to changes in pricing risk factors within the risk categories in the scope of the model are considered, and the other pricing risk factors outside the scope of the model are held fixed.$^{31}$ For example, (i) if the institution is authorised to use an internal model for general interest rate risk only, the hypothetical P&L should include the changes in value of market parameters pertaining to general interest rate risk only; or (ii) if FX risk is not in the scope of the model, market value changes due to changes in the FX rate should not be reflected in the hypothetical P&L.$^{32}$|193
2396|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 76|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.5 Calculation of hypothetical P&L|In the case of partial use models, only for those instruments or transactions where the exclusion of the P&L stemming from risk categories not included in the scope of the internal model is operationally challenging or its effect on the total P&L is immaterial, an institution may include in the hypothetical P&L those changes in value of market parameters pertaining to all risk categories.$^{33}$ Institutions should be able to justify the immateriality or the operational challenge, if applicable. In particular, excluding the effect of FX risk in the hypothetical P&L is not automatically deemed to be operationally challenging.|144
2397|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 77|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.5 Calculation of hypothetical P&L|77. The passage of time effect (theta effect) should be considered (or not) in the VaR and in the hypothetical P&L in a consistent manner. However, if institutions include the passage of time in the P&L and not in the VaR, or vice versa, they should be able to demonstrate that the effect of this inconsistency is not material.$^{34}$|102
2398|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 78|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.6 Counting of overshootings|78. In accordance with Article 366(2) and (3) of the CRR, the back-testing addend is determined as the higher of the number of overshootings under hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the portfolio for the most recent 250 business days.|81
2399|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 79|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.6 Counting of overshootings|"79. In accordance with Article 366(5) of the CRR, institutions must notify the competent authorities promptly, and in any case no later than within five working days, of overshootings that result from their back-testing programme. The ECB understands that the period of five working days should start on the fir st working day after the ""subsequent day"" as referred to in the second and third paragraphs of Article 366(3) of the CRR."|118
2400|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 80|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.6 Counting of overshootings|80. If either a P&L or the VaR is not available or cannot be computed within five working days, the ECB considers that there is a risk that an overshooting may have occurred, and that in order to ensure that the number of overshootings is not misrepresented, a prudent approach would be to consider such an instance as an overshooting under hypothetical or actual changes, respectively.|103
2401|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 81|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.6 Counting of overshootings|81. If an overshooting has occurred due to malfunctions in the calculation of a P&L or the VaR and is notified to the ECB, and the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the ECB that the overshooting was caused by an acceptable reason, the institution may withdraw the overshooting notification. The explanation of the malfunction should be supported by clear and complete documentation. If malfunctions leading to erroneous calculations and overshooting notifications are recurrent, this may indicate that the internal model is not implemented with integrity as required in Article 368(1) of the CRR, and the ECB may require the institution to present a remediation plan.|153
2402|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 82|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.6 Counting of overshootings|"82. The ECB considers that examples of acceptable reasons for withdrawing an overshooting notification could include: 
(a) errors in the calculation of the actual P&L, hypothetical P&L or VaR due to IT issues or incorrect data; 
(b) errors in the scope of positions for the calculations of the P&L or the VaR; 
(c) false or missing bookings, or incorrect positions included in the scope of the calculations; 
(d) delayed reserve releases; 
(e) temporary transmission problems between different business locations."|131
2403|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 83|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.6 Counting of overshootings|"83. However, the ECB considers the following to be a non-exhaustive list of reasons for withdrawing an overshooting notification which would not be acceptable, because they are not considered as malfunctions in the calculation of the P&L or the VaR: 
(a) differences in pricing functions between the VaR engine and the actual and hypothetical P&L calculations (typically using front-office pricing functions); 
(b) losses due to the trading or transfer of large positions at a price that deviates from the market price as a result of trading volumes; 
(c) the overshooting corresponds to a small difference between VaR and a P&L; 
(d) unexpected market movements; 
(e) a model deficiency that has caused an overshooting in the past has already been addressed (there is no backward adjustment of overshootings); 
(f) a change in the P&L calculation method, pricing function or parameterisation of a pricing function or a change in the market data input used in the P&L calculation."|230
2404|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 84|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.6 Counting of overshootings|84. In accordance with Article 368(1)(a) of the CRR, the internal model must be closely integrated into the daily risk management process. In order for institutions to be able to meet this requirement, the ECB considers that the VaR numbers should be available within three business days. In addition, this would enable institutions to fulfil the requirement to notify back-testing overshootings within five business days.|107
2405|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 84|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.6 Counting of overshootings|If delays in the VaR computation are recurrent, this may indicate that the internal model is not implemented with integrity as required by Article 368(1) of the CRR, and the ECB may require the institution to justify such delays or to present a remediation plan.|78
2406|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 85|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.7 Analysis of overshootings|"85. In accordance with Article 368(1)(b) of the CRR, the risk control unit must produce and analyse daily reports on the output of any internal model, including overshootings. The ECB considers that such an analysis of overshootings should include at least the following areas, as they are the most relevant drivers of the VaR number: 
(a) identification of the set of positions responsible for the overshooting (portfolio analysis); 
(b) identification, description and analysis of the market moves contributing to the overshooting (market analysis); 
(c) identification of possible weaknesses in the internal model in the light of (a) and (b) above (analysis of the internal model)."|165
2407|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 85|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.7 Analysis of overshootings|Paragraphs 86 to 89 explain what the ECB considers are best practices in order to analyse each of the three areas referred to in (a), (b) and (c) above.|61
2408|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 85|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.7 Analysis of overshootings|The ECB considers it best practice that for every regulatory back-testing overshooting a detailed analysis should be performed by the institution and provided to the competent authority within one month.$^{35}$|58
2409|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 85|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.7 Analysis of overshootings|In accordance with Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR, any internal model for market risk must have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks. In order to assess the track record of reasonably accuracy in measuring risk, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, request a detailed analysis (in accordance with its specific instructions) of overshootings and reporting of time series related to back-testing.|114
2410|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 86|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.7 Analysis of overshootings > 3.7.1 Portfolio analysis|86. The analysis of the back-testing overshooting should include a detailed description of the trading portfolio for which the one-day VaR forecast calculated was exceeded by the one-day change in the portfolio's value. If the overshooting was notified for the actual P&L, the intraday changes in the portfolio that affected the actual change should also be analysed.|103
2411|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 87|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.7 Analysis of overshootings > 3.7.1 Portfolio analysis|87. The analysis of back-testing overshooting should be performed not only at the overall portfolio level, but also at lower portfolio levels, to identify the main positions that caused the overshooting. If specific sub-portfolios can be identified, they should be mentioned and analysed.|86
2412|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 88|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.7 Analysis of overshootings > 3.7.2 Market analysis|88. The analysis of the market should describe the market moves contributing to the cause of the overshooting and explain them on the basis of objective market data (for example, asset prices, indices, interest rates, FX rates, implied correlations and volatilities). To assess the significance of the market data movements, the market data, including those that are risk factors in the VaR, should be analysed in a historical context. The significance of the change in market data that are risk factors in the VaR, and which contributed to the P&L, should be tested against the historical 99% confidence interval of risk factor changes. Changes in the structure of correlations between the risk factors should also be analysed. In addition, the analysis should, as far as possible, include the economic reasons for the market movements.|195
2413|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 89|Other|Market risk > 3 Regulatory back-testing of VaR models > 3.7 Analysis of overshootings > 3.7.3 Analysis of the internal model|"89. The suitability of the internal model should be assessed on the basis of the two previous analyses. Where positions contributing to the back-testing overshooting can be identified, the appropriateness of the model for these particular positions should be assessed. To do this, the part of the P&L that can be explained by the model (i.e. risk factors and pricing functions) should be distinguished from the part which cannot. In addition, the reliability of the VaR calculation and of the actual and hypothetical changes in the portfolio should be evaluated. The analysis of the internal model should focus on: 
(a) the appropriateness of risk factors used; 
(b) the modelling of risk factors; 
(c) the suitability of the processes for calculating VaR, hypothetical P&L and actual P&L."|198
2414|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 89|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.1 Regulatory references|Once adopted by the European Commission, the Final draft RTS on assessment methodology for IMA and significant share will become an additional relevant regulatory reference.

2415|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 90|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.2 Frequency of internal validation|90. Institutions are required under Article 369(1) of the CRR to conduct a validation of their internal models on a periodic basis. The ECB considers that an appropriate frequency is at least annually, as one year is a reasonable time in which significant changes in the market or in the composition of the portfolio could occur. 36 In addition, a validation conducted at least annually would allow the institution to use the results in the review of its overall risk management process, as referred to in Article 368(2) of the CRR.|133
2416|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 91|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.3 Internal back-testing of VaR models > 4.3.1 Granularity of internal back-testing|"91. In accordance with Article 369(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions must, in addition to the regulatory back-testing programmes, carry out their own internal model validation tests - including back-testing - in relation to the risks and the structure of their portfolios. The ECB considers that to satisfy the requirement regarding internal back-testing in relation to the risks and the structure of the portfolios, institutions should perform separate back-testing at more granular levels than the top-of-the-house level 37 on at least the hypothetical P&L (i.e. counting and analysing of overshootings under the hypothetical P&L). 
(a) The ECB understands that, at a minimum, internal back-testing should be performed: 
(i) at one level below the top-of-the-house level; 
(ii) for each portfolio that is subject to a separate VaR limit established by the institution's management body. 
(b) Where an institution intends to apply the revisions to the IMA as set out in the fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB) in the future, the ECB considers that it would be beneficial if the institution identified the subportfolios within the current scope of the internal model that would most likely satisfy the requirements for becoming FRTB trading desks, and performed separate internal back-testing on them."|305
2417|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 91|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.3 Internal back-testing of VaR models > 4.3.1 Granularity of internal back-testing|This is without prejudice to the requirement for the internal model validation function to perform back-testing on both actual and hypothetical P&L under Article 369(2) of the CRR, which the ECB understands as relating to the top-ofthe-house level.|90

2419|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 92|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.3 Internal back-testing of VaR models > 4.3.1 Granularity of internal back-testing|92. The ECB understands that Article 369(2) of the CRR requires that the backtesting performed in internal validation complies with the same requirements as the regulatory back-testing regarding the calculation of actual and hypothetical P&L. Therefore, the requirements described in Section 3 regarding the calculation of actual and hypothetical P&L should also be applied to internal back-testing, in order to ensure consistency. In verifying compliance with this provision of the CRR, the ECB will take into account the specific circumstances of the institution.|145
2420|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 93|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.3 Internal back-testing of VaR models > 4.3.2 Tests to be performed in internal back-testing|"93. In accordance with Article 369(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions must carry out their own internal model validation tests, including back-testing. The ECB considers it best practice that the periodic internal validation tests include the following (or their equivalent) for at least the top-of-the-house level: 
(a) statistical tests on the overshootings, such as the Kupiec 39 and Christoffersen 40 tests, including an analysis of the validity of the hypotheses underlying those statistical tests; 
(b) a test on the uniformity of the distribution of the p-values 41 of the daily actual P&L and the hypothetical P&L in the daily forecasts of P&Ls of the VaR 42 engine, at least for the daily data of the last year. For example, a P&L value equal to the VaR at confidence level of 99% corresponds to a p-value of 0.01."|236

2428|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 95|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.4 Validation on hypothetical portfolios|95. In accordance with Article 369(1) of the CRR, institutions must have processes in place to ensure that all their internal models for market risk have been adequately validated. Therefore, the requirement of Article 369(1)(c) to use hypothetical portfolios in the internal model validation refers in particular to VaR, sVaR, and IRC models.|98
2429|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 96|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.4 Validation on hypothetical portfolios|"96. In accordance with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions must have a documented set of internal policies and controls in place concerning the overall operation of their internal models, including the internal validation. Therefore, institutions should have a policy in place that governs the overall processes related to the validation of their internal models for market risk using hypothetical portfolios. The ECB considers that in order to cover the overall process, such a policy should comprise the following aspects: 
(a) portfolio definition - the processes for defining hypothetical portfolios; 
(b) analysis - the processes for analysing the performance of the model based on the results of the tests performed on hypothetical portfolios, including: 
(i) an assessment of the ability of the models to capture the risk of the hypothetical portfolios; 
(ii) verification that the insights gained by the analysis of hypothetical portfolios are reflected in the models; 
(iii) in particular, for back-testing on hypothetical portfolios, an identification of the market movements and parameters causing overshootings; 
(c) reporting - the processes to ensure that the results of validation on hypothetical portfolios are reported to a management body with sufficient authority in respect of internal models."|261
2430|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 97|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.4 Validation on hypothetical portfolios|97. In accordance with Article 369(1)(c) of the CRR, institutions must conduct validation exercises using hypothetical portfolios in order to ensure that a model is able to account for particular structural features. 43 The ECB understands that these hypothetical portfolios should have targeted compositions so that the model can be tested at a level of granularity that enables the identification and isolation of specific model performance for those structural features (for example, related to specific business lines, instrument features, and/or trading strategies).|123
2431|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 98|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.4 Validation on hypothetical portfolios|98. As they should ensure that the risk model is validated for the institution's risk management purposes, such hypothetical portfolios should be designed in line with the business model of the institution. For example, it is not necessary to include products that are not covered by trader mandates, nor to test specific features that are not relevant for potential positions according to the institution's approved trading strategy. Consequently, an institution should review the hypothetical portfolios in the event of a change in its business model or trading strategy.|122
2432|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 99|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.4 Validation on hypothetical portfolios|99. For the same reason, the number of hypothetical portfolios should be commensurate with the nature, scale and complexity of the activities of the institution.|55
2433|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 100|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.5 Validation based on hypothetical portfolios for VaR models by internal back-testing|100. The ECB considers that the validation requirements of Article 369(1)(c) of the CRR for VaR models can be fulfilled by internal back-testing where an institution can demonstrate that it has set up internal back-testing for the VaR model using sub-portfolios at a level which is sufficiently granular to account for the particular structural features that may arise in its portfolios.|110
2434|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 101|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.5 Validation based on hypothetical portfolios for VaR models by internal back-testing|101. Where an institution performs internal back-testing on hypothetical portfolios for the VaR model, the P&L calculations for this back-testing of hypothetical portfolios should not differ from the P&L calculations for regulatory VaR backtesting as described in Section 3, in order to ensure consistency. This backtesting can be conducted based on the hypothetical P&L only, as hypothetical portfolios are not part of the daily trading activity and therefore the actual P&L is not relevant.|128
2435|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 102|Other|Market risk > 4 Aspects of internal validation of market risk models > 4.5 Validation based on hypothetical portfolios for VaR models by internal back-testing|"102. As the purpose of such internal back-testing is the internal validation of the VaR model, the ECB considers that in order to ensure consistency: 
(a) the comparison should be carried out using the daily hypothetical P&L and the one-day VaR; 
(b) back-testing periods for hypothetical portfolios should cover at least the period used to calibrate the VaR as of the validation date, to ensure that the results are relevant for the model at that date; 
(c) institutions should ensure that the particular structural feature, as referred to in paragraph 97, for which each hypothetical portfolio was selected, continues to be in place over time and during the entire historical period for which the back-testing is performed."|177

2437|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 103|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|103. In accordance with Article 369(1) of the CRR, the appropriateness of any assumptions made within the internal model must be demonstrated. Therefore, institutions should demonstrate the appropriateness of any assumptions about the distribution of risk factors included in the VaR and sVaR models on the basis of objective data. 45 In order to assess the appropriateness of the distribution assumptions, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to consider different plausible distribution assumptions and compare the VaR and sVaR amounts calculated according to those different assumptions to demonstrate that the selected assumption is appropriate.|154
2438|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 104|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|104. In accordance with Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR, an internal model must be reasonably accurate in measuring risks. Therefore, when using Monte Carlo simulations, institutions should be able to demonstrate that the number of simulations used to compute the VaR and sVaR is sufficient to produce accurate and stable VaR and sVaR numbers.|95
2439|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 105|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|105. An institution may apply different methodologies (i.e. the absolute, relative or mixed approach$^{46}$) to calculate returns used to calibrate the VaR and sVaR models for different risk factors. The ECB has observed that the best practices used in the VaR and sVaR models are the following methodologies:|89
2440|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 105|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|As institutions are required under Article 368(3) of the CRR to apply best practices, they should be able to explain deviations from these methodologies and quantify the impact of those deviations.|59
2441|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 105|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|Article 365(2) of the CRR requires that the calculation of the sVaR is made in accordance with the requirements for calculation of the VaR. Therefore, for a given risk factor, where a specific methodology is used in the VaR, the same methodology is expected to be used for the same risk factor in the sVaR.|92
2442|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 105|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|As regime changes could occur between the VaR effective historical observation period and the sVaR historical period, the method should be suitable for both periods. In accordance with Article 369(1) of the CRR, the appropriateness of any assumptions made within the internal model must be demonstrated. The ECB considers that this choice of method is one of the assumptions whose appropriateness should be demonstrated.|102
2443|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 106|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|106. In accordance with Article 368(1) of the CRR, the internal model must be conceptually sound and implemented with integrity. Therefore, it is expected that the returns are calculated on the basis of one single holding period (for example, one day or ten days) for all risk factors.$^{47}$|87
2444|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 107|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|107. Under paragraph 10.3(c) of the EBA Guidelines on sVaR, institutions should be able to prove that on the day of the week chosen for the sVaR calculation their portfolio is representative of the portfolio held during that week, and that the chosen portfolio does not lead to a systematic underestimation of the sVaR numbers when computed weekly; shown, for example, by using sensitivities or by proving that the VaR is not systematically lower on the day of the week chosen for sVaR.|130
2445|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 108|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|108. In order to assess that the day of the week when the sVaR amounts are calculated does not lead to material bias, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require an institution to recalculate the sVaR for 15 consecutive business days (including three reporting days). If it is not possible to perform this calculation in the production environment, it can be performed in a test environment that replicates the calculation of the regulatory sVaR.|122
2446|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 109|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.2 General requirements|109. In accordance with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions must ensure compliance with a documented set of internal controls. In order for the ECB to assess compliance with this requirement, an institution should be able to provide an inventory of all open validation findings in relation to the VaR and sVaR models including, for each finding, a description thereof, the envisaged remedial action and the target date for closure of the finding. In addition, institutions should retain closed validation findings for at least one year after the closure date and should be able to provide a description of the remedial action implemented. Furthermore, to allow the ECB to assess compliance with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, an institution should be able to provide an inventory of analyses that have been conducted with the purpose of developing/justifying the VaR and sVaR models over the last five years.|208
2447|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 110|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|110. In accordance with Article 365(1)(d) of the CRR, institutions must use an effective historical observation period of at least one year for the calculation of the VaR, except where a shorter observation period is justified by a significant upsurge in price volatility. The ECB considers that this requirement can be fulfilled by taking returns referring to 250 consecutive business days 48 in order to allow alignment with the time frame referred to in Article 366(2) of the CRR. The ECB understands that an effective historical observation period of at least one year means that the average time lag 49 of the scheme used by an institution is at least the average time lag for an equally weighted observation period of one year (i.e. 125.5 days for 250 business days).$^{50}$|208
2448|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 111|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|"111. Where the institution uses a shorter effective historical observation period (for example, by applying a weighting scheme) due to a significant upsurge in price volatility, the ECB considers that this should not lead to a lower VaR risk number. Therefore, the institution should use the higher of the following: 
(a) the VaR amount calculated with an equally weighted historical observation period of at least one year; 
(b) the VaR amount calculated with the shorter effective historical observation period.$^{51}$"|144
2449|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 111|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|In accordance with Article 365(1)(e) of the CRR, this comparison should be performed at least monthly, and the institution should continue to apply the resulting calibration method until the next comparison.|83
2450|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 111|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|Average time lag ( 𝑛, 𝑤 ) = ∑ 𝑡·𝑤 𝑡 𝑛 𝑡=1 ∑ 𝑤 𝑡 𝑛 𝑡=1|91

For an equally weighted scheme on 250 continuous business days, the formula results in 125.5 days.|94
2452|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 112|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|112. For the purpose of the regulatory back-testing conducted under Article 366 of the CRR, the higher of the two metrics mentioned in paragraph 111 should be used for consistency with the own funds requirement calculation.|86
2453|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 112|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|If the institution always uses a VaR calculated with the shorter effective observation period as mentioned in paragraph 111 for its risk management, the institution is allowed to perform internal back-testing of the VaR under Article 369(1)(b) of the CRR using this shorter effective observation period, in order to ensure that the model is closely integrated into the daily risk management process.|118
2454|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 113|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|113. In accordance with Article 365(2) of the CRR, the institution must calculate the sVaR calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress relevant to the institution's portfolio. The ECB considers that this requirement can be fulfilled by taking returns referring to 250 consecutive business days in order to allow alignment with the time frame referred to in Article 366(2) of the CRR.|131
2455|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 113|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|Under paragraph 6.8 of the EBA Guidelines on sVaR, no weighting of historical data should be applied when determining the relevant historical period or when calibrating the sVaR model. 52 The ECB considers that a calibration to historical data from a continuous 12-month period implies that no weighting scheme should be applied to the historical data used to calibrate the sVaR.$^{53}$|125
2456|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 114|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|114. In order to ensure that the approach for measuring empirical correlations is sound and implemented with integrity as required by Article 367(3) of the CRR, the institution should use one single observation period (i.e. with the same start date and end date, and consequently the same length of observation period) for all risk factors modelled in the VaR. This also applies to the sVaR.|126
2457|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 115|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|115. Consequently, if a new instrument (e.g. a single stock or credit index series) is issued, the time series corresponding to this instrument should not be used on its own for the calibration of the VaR and sVaR models until the length of the available time series reaches the length of the observation period used by the institution. In this case, because, at the least, the missing portion needs to be completed, a risk factor calibrated to this time series is considered to be proxied and the requirements for proxies should be observed (see Section 5.5).|160
2458|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 116|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|116. In accordance with Article 365 of the CRR, the VaR and sVaR are calculated as the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval, and In accordance with Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, the model must accurately capture all material price risks. In accordance with Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR, any internal model must have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks. Therefore, the ECB considers that for institutions using a simulation approach (either historical or Monte Carlo) in their VaR (or sVaR) model, the percentile estimation method used to obtain the 99th percentile should be based on reasonable statistical properties that ensure its accuracy - that is, it should be asymptotically unbiased, distribution-free, and assume that the probability of experiencing a P&L lower (or higher) than the lowest (or highest) simulated value is strictly greater than zero. For these reasons the ECB considers that both the method proposed by Harrell and Davis 54 55 and the simplified method proposed below 56 are appropriate methods to ensure that price risks are accurately captured when using the percentile estimation method.|283
2459|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 116|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|Consider the vector of simulated P&L of length $_{𝑛}$ for the VaR (or sVaR) percentile estimation $_{(P&L}$$_{1}$$_{ }$ to $_{P&L}$$_{𝑛}$) in ascending order. 57 The result $_{𝑄(0.99)}$ is obtained as the weighted average of the two subsequent P&L values -P&L$_{Int(𝑚)}$ and $_{-P&L}$$_{Int(𝑚)+1}$, computed as with $_{𝑚 =}$ 𝑛+1 $_{100}$.|182
2460|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 116|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.3 Data inputs, length of the time series used to calibrate VaR and sVaR, and quantile estimation|For example: for $_{𝑛 = 250}$, the percentile result of this method is 0.51 × (-P&L$_{3}$) + 0.49 × (-P&L$_{2}$) ; for $_{𝑛 = 260}$, the percentile result of this method is 0.61 × (-P&L$_{3}$) + 0.39 × (-P&L$_{2}$) .|141
2461|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 117|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.4 Data quality|117. In accordance with Article 367(2)(e) of the CRR, an internal model must meet minimum data standards. This applies in particular to risk factor time series, which are fundamental inputs to a VaR model. For each risk factor time series used to calibrate the shocks of the VaR model, the institution should have a process in place to regularly check the quality of the time series. The ECB considers that an appropriate minimum frequency of such checks is quarterly, as this allows alignment with the regulatory reporting cycle. This is without prejudice to the discretion of institutions to perform certain checks on a more frequent basis if needed to meet minimum data standards. Where an institution uses different data sources for its VaR model and the daily economic P&L calculation reflected in the inventory referred to in paragraph 130, the ECB may request that the institution explain the differences between the two sets of data sources, in order to verify that they meet minimum data standards.|215
2462|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 118|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.4 Data quality|"118. The ECB understands that the minimum data standards should ensure that the true volatility of a position or portfolio is captured. Therefore, the quality checks on the risk factor time series should, at the minimum, identify for each time series: 
(a) the number of days for which data points were initially missing and th en fil led using a particular methodology (e.g. interpolation and extrapolation);$^{58}$ 
(b) the number of days for which data points were initially available and were replaced using a particular methodology (e.g. interpolation and extrapolation); 
(c) the number of days with no daily changes; 
(d) the maximum number of consecutive days with no daily change."|160
2463|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 119|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.4 Data quality|"119. Material or large numbers of changes in the time series may affect the ability to capture the true volatility of a position or portfolio. In order to monitor and ensure that the operation of the internal model is not adversely affected, institutions should maintain up-to-date documentation 59 describing any changes in the risk factor time series, including in particular any methodology for the replacement of missing data, and the list of tasks that may be performed during manual adjustments. This documentation should contain the following: 
(a) a description of the methodology followed to introduce the adjustment the description should be sufficiently detailed so that any staff member of the unit in charge is able to produce the same outcome; 
(b) a description of the processes in place to ensure the appropriate implementation of a manual process in accordance with the documentation."|180
2464|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 120|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.4 Data quality|120. In accordance with Article 367(2)(e) of the CRR, the institution's internal model must conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency and must meet minimum data standards. Therefore, the ECB considers that institutions should have in place documentation which defines the minimum data quality standards that risk factor time series should meet, and be able to provide justification for the use of time series that include an elevated number of consecutive business days with missing data or no daily changes. Moreover, the ECB considers that when using time series with only a low number of available data points per year institutions should provide justification that the number of data points is sufficient to reflect the true volatility of a position or portfolio.|169
2465|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 121|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.4 Data quality|"121. In order to ensure that changes in the risk factor time series do not affect the ability to capture the true volatility of a position or portfolio, institutions should analyse how the replacement of missing data affects the volatilities and correlations of the IMA. This applies particularly where time series are used that have: 
(a) the value of the same data of the previous day in the case of automatic and systematic replacement of missing data points; 
(b) an elevated number of consecutive business days with missing data or no daily changes; 
(c) only a low number of data points per year before any data cleaning or treatment."|147
2466|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 121|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.4 Data quality|Filtering of data or exclusions of outliers should not be performed unless the institution can demonstrate that the excluded data points correspond to erroneous or stale data and do not represent the real market volatility of the risk factors. As part of the requirement under Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR to have procedures for ensuring compliance with controls concerning the overall operation of internal models, the ECB considers that institutions should keep track of any exclusion made in the risk factor time series used to calculate VaR and sVaR.|124
2467|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 122|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.4 Data quality|122. Conversely, automatic and systematic filtering of data leading to exclusions of high or low returns should not be performed without further analysis and documentation.|51
2468|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 123|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|123. For the purposes of this guide, the ECB understands that market data are proxied in the calculation of the VaR or sVaR 60 when market data that are used as inputs in the pricing model to compute the economic P&L for an IMA position are replaced with other market data 61 (or a weighted average of market data) for the purpose of calibrating the VaR or sVaR (respectively) for that position.|122
2469|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 123|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|Where for the economic P&L a certain market data input (for example, the directly observable price of an instrument) is used, while the VaR or sVaR model (respectively) uses other market data that would lead to an equivalent price, the ECB considers that these data should not be considered as proxies.$^{62}$|95
2470|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 123|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|Conversely, if the data would not lead to an equivalent price, they should be considered as proxies.|47
2471|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 123|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|In accordance with Article 367(1)(b) of the CRR, where a risk factor is incorporated into the institution's pricing model but not into the risk measurement model, the institution must be able to justify such an omission to the satisfaction of the competent authority. Therefore, the ECB considers that in the event of reduced granularity of market data inputs for curves or surfaces in the VaR or sVaR model, as compared with the economic P&L, an institution should duly justify why the data points interpolated owing to the reduced granularity should not be considered as proxies (e.g. by means of equivalent price as mentioned above).|154
2472|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 124|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|124. In accordance with Article 370(e) of the CRR, an internal model used for specific risk must capture name-related basis risk, and in particular be sensitive to material idiosyncratic differences between similar, but not identical, positions. The ECB therefore considers that the use of each single stock price (where available) as a risk factor in the VaR or sVaR is the best practice for modelling specific risk for equity instruments. Similarly, the direct use of idiosyncratic market data (where available) (for example, the idiosyncratic bond spread or each single-name credit default swap) as a risk factor is considered to be the best practice for modelling specific risk for debt instruments.|175
2473|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 124|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|However, the use of beta approximations or regressions could be accepted if they are documented and regularly validated (i.e. they are shown to lead to good model performance) as required by Articles 368(1)(e) and 369 of the CRR. Institutions with internal model approval for specific risk should be able to demonstrate that the idiosyncratic volatility of equity or debt instruments with specific risk is correctly taken into account in the VaR and sVaR models.|125
2474|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 125|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|125. The ECB considers that in order to demonstrate that the model captures accurately all material price risks as required by Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, the institution should document and make available upon request an inventory of time series of risk factors that are proxied for the calibration of the VaR and sVaR models, together with the materiality of the corresponding risk factors.|108
2475|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 126|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|126. The ECB considers that the requirement to have a documented set of internal policies and controls also applies to the use of proxies, as they are part of the overall operation of internal models. Therefore, institutions should have a policy in place that defines clear processes for deriving and validating each proxy for VaR and sVaR. The policy should further define a set of controls (for example, statistical analysis or comparison against alternative proxies) that should be performed to ensure the appropriateness of proxies.|127
2476|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 127|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|127. As a control to ensure that the proxies are appropriately conservative and are reflective of the true volatility where sufficient market data are available, institutions should perform analyses to show that the proxy market data (i) are highly correlated with the market data used for economic P&L, and (ii) show a similar level of volatility for VaR and sVaR. Where analyses based on market data used for economic P&L are not feasible, institutions should at least assess alternative plausible proxy choices.|127
2477|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 127|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|In particular, institutions which have approved internal models for specific risk of debt instruments or specific risk of equity instruments should demonstrate that the use of a proxy enables the idiosyncratic risk to be appropriately captured as required by Article 370(e) of the CRR.|81
2478|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 128|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|128. As proxies are part of the internal models, any proxy should also be validated for VaR and sVaR at least annually in accordance with Section 4.2 on the frequency of regular internal validation.|71
2479|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 129|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.5 Proxies, beta approximation and regressions|"129. In order to assess that proxies are appropriately conservative and reflective of the true volatility, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require an institution to provide, for a selection of sub-portfolios, business days, and material proxies: 
(a) the hypothetical P&L used for regulatory back-testing; 
(b) the hypothetical P&L calculated on the same unchanged positions but replacing, for the positions for which proxies are used in the VaR, the market data with the market data of their proxies;

2491|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 135|Other|Market risk > 5 Methodology for VaR and stressed VaR > 5.7 Pricing functions and methods in the model|135. As for any other assumption in an internal model, the differences in the pricing functions and methods used for the calculation of the VaR and sVaR, compared with those used for the calculation of the economic P&L, should be subject to validation 66 in accordance with Article 369(1) of the CRR. This validation should include any simplifications of pricing functions and methods introduced for use for VaR or sVaR-related purposes (for example, a reduced number of parameters or simulations). The validation should be performed at least initially when a pricing method is introduced into the VaR or sVaR calculation that is not identical to the one for economic P&L purposes, and should assess the impact of the use of different pricing methods. Additionally, a regular validation should be performed in order to check that this impact remains low. The scorecard indicator mentioned above should be based on the results from this (initial and regular) validation. The institution should develop a work plan to mitigate the risk or improve the quality of any pricing functions or methods that are deemed inadequate according to the institution's assessment in the scorecard (i.e. a red indicator).|263

In order to assess the accuracy and appropriateness of the pricing functions and methods in the VaR and sVaR models, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to provide, for a selection of sub-portfolios, business days, and pricing functions/methods: 
(a) the hypothetical P&L used for regulatory back-testing as defined in Section 3.5;

2495|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 137|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|137. Under paragraph 29.2 of the EBA Guidelines on the IRC, institutions should be able to prove that, on the day of the week chosen for the IRC calculation, their portfolio is representative of the portfolio held during the week and that the chosen portfolio does not lead to a systematic underestimation of the IRC numbers when computed weekly (for example, by using sensitivities or jump-todefault).|105
2496|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 138|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|138. In order to assess that the day of the week when the IRC numbers are calculated does not lead to material bias, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require an institution to recalculate the IRC for 15 consecutive business days (including three reporting days). If it is not possible to perform this calculation in the production environment, it can be performed in a test environment replicating the calculation of the regulatory IRC.|115
2497|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 139|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|139. In accordance with Article 374(4) of the CRR, the IRC model must be based on the assumptions of a constant level of risk over the one-year time horizon or, alternatively, on the assumption of a one-year constant position. As with any other modelling assumption, an institution should be able to demonstrate that the chosen assumption appropriately captures the risk of its portfolio.|99
2498|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 139|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|In order to assess the appropriateness of that choice, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require an institution that uses a constant level of risk assumption and liquidity horizons shorter than one year to calculate the impact of using a constant position assumption on the IRC and the default risk in the IRC 67 amounts.|93
2499|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 140|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|140. In accordance with Article 375(1) of the CRR, hedging or diversification effects associated with long and short positions may only be recognised by explicitly modelling gross long and short positions in the different instruments, and institutions must reflect the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies, in particular by maturity. Therefore, the ECB considers that irrespective of whether a one-year constant position assumption or a constant level of risk assumption is used, institutions should not overestimate diversification or hedging effects, and in particular should ensure that maturity mismatches between long and short positions occurring within the liquidity horizon or within the one-year risk modelling horizon do not lead to an underestimation of risk.$^{68}$|165
2500|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 140|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|In accordance with Article 376(3)(c) of the CRR, as part of the annual independent review and the initial and periodic validation of its IRC model, an institution must apply appropriate quantitative validation. Therefore, the ECB considers that institutions should, as part of the annual independent review and the initial and periodic validation of their IRC models, assess quantitatively how maturity mismatches - that may lead to imbalanced positions within the modelling horizon - impact the IRC and the default risk in the IRC amounts.$^{69}$|126
2501|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 141|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|141. In accordance with Article 372(d) in conjunction with Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR, an IRC model must be reasonably accurate in measuring risks. Therefore, an institution should be able to demonstrate that the number of simulations used in its model to compute the IRC and the default risk in the IRC is sufficient to ensure accurate and stable IRC amounts.|98
2502|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 142|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|142. In order to assess the accuracy of the IRC calculations, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to calculate a confidence interval of IRC estimation with a confidence level of 95%.|70
2503|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 143|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|143. Under paragraph 17.2 of the EBA Guidelines on the IRC, institutions should use one (or, where relevant data are available, more than one) migration matrix that is specific to sovereign issuers (where relevant). Therefore, institutions should use a separate migration matrix for other types of issuers. Where an institution uses only one matrix for all types of issuers, it should be able to demonstrate that this leads to conservative IRC amounts.$^{70}$|116
2504|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 144|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.2 General requirements|144. In accordance with Article 372(d) in conjunction with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions must ensure compliance with a documented set of internal controls related to their IRC model. So that the ECB can assess compliance with this requirement, an institution should be able to provide an inventory of all open validation findings in relation to its IRC model, including a description of the finding, the envisaged remedial action and the target date for clos ure of the findi ng. In addition, institutions should retain closed validation findings for at least one year after the closure date and should be able to provide a description of the remedial action implemented. Furthermore, to allow the ECB to assess compliance with Article 372(d) in conjunction with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, an institution should be able to provide an inventory of analyses that have been conducted with the purpose of developing/justifying the IRC model over the las t fiv e years.|222
2505|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 145|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.3 Data inputs|145. In accordance with Article 376(6) of the CRR, an IRC model must meet minimum data standards. This applies in particular to time series used to calibrate the IRC model, for which the institution should have a process in place to check the quality of the time series regularly. The ECB considers that an appropriate minimum frequency for checking the quality of the time series is quarterly, as this allows alignment with the regulatory reporting cycle. Therefore, the data quality requirements for VaR and sVaR models indicated in paragraphs 118 to 119 and 121 to 122 also apply to the market data used for calibration of the IRC model.|153
2506|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 146|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.4 Distribution and correlation assumptions|146. In accordance with Article 376(3)(a) of the CRR, an institution must, as part of the annual independent review and the initial and periodic validation of its IRC model, validate that its modelling approach for correlations and price changes is appropriate for its portfolio, including the choice and weights of its systematic risk factors. The ECB understands that this provision requires institutions in particular to justify (i) the choice of systematic factor types (for example, region and industry) and, for each type of systematic factor, its granularity, and (ii) the full correlation structure and its calibration for the entire set of risk factors used.|152
2507|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 147|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.4 Distribution and correlation assumptions|147. An institution that does not calibrate the correlations of its IRC model to market data, but instead uses internal ratings based (IRB) correlations, should demonstrate their appropriateness in relation to its portfolio. The ECB considers that owing to the nature of the regulatory trading book, the correlations as defined in Article 153 of the CRR should be used for this purpose.|100
2508|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 148|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.4 Distribution and correlation assumptions|148. In accordance with Article 374(2) of the CRR, correlation assumptions must be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. In accordance with Article 372(d) in conjunction with Article 369(1) of the CRR, institutions must perform tests to demonstrate that any assumptions made within the internal model are appropriate. In view of those two provisions, the ECB considers that any assumption for correlation modelling made by the institution should be supported by objective market data (for example, credit default swap data, equities data or rating migrations data) and justified by a quantitative analysis as part of its initial and periodic validation process. In particular, this quantitative analysis should compare the level of correlation between issuers that is derived from the institution's IRC correlation model and from objective market data. The ECB understands that this requirement also applies to those institutions using an IRB-based methodology and to those using a vendor model.|212
2509|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 149|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.4 Distribution and correlation assumptions|149. In order to assess the appropriateness of the modelling approach for correlations, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to provide correlations for all issuer pairs, and all relevant correlation values according to their factor model, in particular for the systematic factors.|86
2510|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 150|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.4 Distribution and correlation assumptions|150. In accordance with Article 374(2) of the CRR, concentrations under stressed conditions must be reflected in the correlation assumptions of the IRC model. The ECB understands that the use of a short period of data for calibrating the correlations implies the risk that stressed conditions are not appropriately reflected. Therefore, institutions should be able to justify that stressed conditions have been adequately captured and to quantify the impact of using sufficiently long time series capturing a relevant stressed period for calibrating correlations in the IRC and the default risk in the IRC. In accordance with Article 370(c) of the CRR in conjunction with Article 372(d) of the CRR, the IRC model must be robust to an adverse environment. Therefore, the ECB considers that, in order to also ensure a robust calibration of the IRC model, a time series of at least 10 years, capturing a relevant stressed period, is appropriate.$^{71}$|210
2511|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 151|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.4 Distribution and correlation assumptions|"151. In accordance with Article 376(3)(b) of the CRR, institutions must perform sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis to assess the qualitative and quantitative reasonableness of the internal model, particularly with regard to the treatment of concentrations. Because the weights of the systematic risk factors are relevant for the modelling of concentrations, the ECB considers that institutions should - as part of the independent review, and in the initial and periodic validation process - perform sensitivity analyses for the IRC and the default risk in the IRC. In particular, the ECB considers it best practice that this sensitivity analysis includes, as a minimum, the following basic analysis, where systematic risk factor weights or correlations of risk factors 72 in the model are shifted up or down by a fixed value or set to generic values: 
(a) all weights of the systematic factors per issuer, for each issuer, 73 are shifted by +10% in absolute value (not going beyond 100%);$^{74}$ 
(b) all weights of the systematic factors per issuer, for each issuer, are shifted by -10% in absolute value (not going below 0%); 
(c) all weights of the systematic factors per issuer, for each issuer, are set to 0; 
(d) all weights of the systematic factors per issuer, for each issuer, are set to 1; 
(e) all correlations between systematic factors are set to 100% (weights of issuers to their respective systematic factors remain unchanged); 
(f) all correlations between systematic factors are set to 0% (weights of issuers to their respective systematic factors remain unchanged)."|349

2513|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 152|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.4 Distribution and correlation assumptions|152. In order to assess the appropriateness of the modelling approach for correlations, and in particular the choice and weights of the systematic risk factors, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to calculate the IRC and the default risk in the IRC amounts based on a one-factor Merton Model (using one single global systematic risk factor) and one flat correlation with different correlation assumptions: 0%, 5%,10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%. All other inputs into institutions' IRC models remain unchanged.|163

In accordance with Article 374(2) of the CRR, correlation assumptions must be supported by analysis of objective data in a conceptually sound framework. In accordance with Article 376(3)(a) of the CRR, an institution must, as part of the annual independent review and the initial and periodic validation of its IRC model, validate that its modelling approach for correlations is appropriate for its portfolio. In accordance with Article 376(3)(c) of the CRR, institutions must apply appropriate quantitative validation. Under paragraph 25.2(iii) of the EBA Guidelines on the IRC, in the validation process the impact of different copula assumptions should be analysed, for example by testing the impact of different distributional assumptions. Because the copula choice is a key assumption of the modelling approach for correlations, the ECB understands that these provisions require, in particular, that institutions demonstrate the appropriateness of and validate the copula choice of the modelling approach for correlations. The copula choice refers to the copula of the joint multivariate distribution 75 of the risk factors for migration and default and of the joint systematic risk factors, where relevant.|260

Because the copula choice is a key assumption of the modelling approach for correlations and is relevant for the modelling of concentrations, the ECB considers that institutions should - as part of the independent review, and in the initial and periodic validation process - perform sensitivity analyses for different copula assumptions. The ECB considers that the following are suitable choices for comparing the impact of different copulas on the IRC and the default risk in the IRC with respect to the approved model: 
(a) using a Student-t copula for all issuer risk factors with 8 degrees of freedom; 
(b) where relevant, using a Student-t copula for the systematic risk factors with 8 degrees of freedom; 
(c) using a Student-t copula for all issuer risk factors where the degrees of freedom have been calibrated to market data;

In accordance with Article 372(d) in conjunction with 368(1)(e) of the CRR, an institution must have a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of its internal models. The ECB considers that for the IRC model institutions should have in place, in particular: 
(a) methodology and process documents for the determination of probabilities of default (PDs) and recovery rates (RRs), including a process and documentation concerning the fallback approaches applied; 
(b) validation documents demonstrating that the assumptions relating to PDs and RRs are appropriate;

If the ratings, PDs or RRs have been adjusted or have not been assigned using the usual automated process (for example, by manual intervention or deviation from the usual automated process), the institution should maintain a complete list of such ratings, PDs and RRs, and provide the rationale for the adjustment, or (for example) manual intervention or deviation from the usual automated process (as applicable) in each case.|207

In accordance with Article 376(2) of the CRR, the IRC model must be based on data that are objective and up to date. In accordance with Article 368(1)(a), any internal model must be closely integrated into the daily risk management process of the institution and serve as the basis for reporting risk exposures to senior management. Therefore, the ECB considers that institutions should demonstrate, on the basis of objective data, that the PD estimates 78 are appropriate. Furthermore, where the estimates of PDs are not derived in combination with current market prices, institutions should analyse any observed differences between these estimates and estimates that are derived in combination with current market prices where the relevant corrections were performed to obtain real-world PDs. The expectation outlined in the last sentence does not apply to IRC PDs that are PDs from an IRB approach approved by the supervisor.|215

In accordance with Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk must capture accurately all material price risks. In accordance with Article 368(1) of the CRR, an IRC model must be conceptually sound and implemented with integrity. In accordance with Article 372(a) of the CRR, the IRC model must give a meaningful differentiation of risk, and accurate and consistent estimates of incremental default and migration risk. Therefore, the ECB considers that institutions should be able to show that the statistical methodology used to derive PDs is conceptually sound and that PDs are accurate and consistent across all rating grades. The ECB considers that an analysis of the expected range of estimation errors should be performed, in order to assess the accuracy of the estimates. Furthermore, the PD for a rating grade should not be set to zero solely on the basis that no defaults have been observed in the past for that rating grade.|235

In accordance with Article 372(a) of the CRR, the IRC model must give a meaningful differentiation of risk, and accurate and consistent estimates of incremental default and migration risk. In accordance with Article 375(1) of the CRR, institutions must reflect the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies by internal or external rating and other differences in the instruments. 79 Therefore, the ECB understands that all annual PDs should be risk sensitive and greater than zero 80 for all obligors. In this context, the term ""greater than zero"" is interpreted to mean greater than, or equal to, one basis point. Furthermore, in the ECB's understanding, ""risk sensitive"" implies that all annual PDs should increase strictly in line with the decreasing creditworthiness of the obligor. The ECB also considers that institutions should calculate the PD ratios between adjacent rating grades and analyse these ratios to understand potential differences from other ratios or the median of the ratios."|286

In accordance with Article 376(6) of the CRR, proxies must be appropriately conservative and may be used only where the available data are insufficient. The ECB is aware that for positions where a reliable PD assignment is not possible due to a lack of adequate data (for example, where no internal or external ratings or liquid credit spread time series are available) institutions apply a fallback PD value. As fallback PD values are used when the available data are insufficient, the ECB considers them as proxies. In order to ensure that fallback PDs are appropriately conservative, the ECB considers it best practice that the fallback PD assigned to each of those issuers and positions is at least equal to the higher of the following. 
(a) The PD that is equivalent to the worst investment grade rating applicable, according to the institution's sources for the determination of PDs - those institutions using internal rating approaches for the assignment of PDs should use the PD that is equivalent to the worst investment grade rating in their internal rating scales. 
(b) The equally weighted 83 average PD 84 of those issuers included in the IRC model which are not subject to the fallback approach. Institutions may exclude defaulted issuers when calculating the equally weighted average PD, provided that they can ensure that the fallback PD is not applied to defaulted issuers."|305

In accordance with Article 372(a) of the CRR, the IRC model must provide a meaningful differentiation of risk, and accurate and consistent estimates of risk. In accordance with Article 376(2) of the CRR, the IRC model must be based on data that are objective and up to date. Therefore, the ECB considers that institutions should periodically assess the materiality of those issuers and positions that are assigned a fallback PD in the IRC model. The ECB considers that a suitable analysis for this purpose consists of the following: 
(a) a comparison of the jump-to-default risk (where applicable, by using the average of the RRs in the case of a stochastic RR) of those positions that are assigned fallback PDs with the jump-to-default risk of all positions in the IRC model;

In accordance with Article 372(a) of the CRR, the IRC model must provide a meaningful differentiation of risk. The ECB considers that if a significant percentage of the IRC is calculated using fallback PDs, there is a risk that the IRC model may not provide the meaningful differentiation of risk required. The ECB considers that if the percentage of the IRC calculated using fallback PDs is larger than 10%, 86 the institution should investigate whether additional data sources are available to reduce the percentage of issuers subject to the fallback PD assignment.|150

In the event that the resulting percentage of the IRC calculated using fallback PDs is larger than 10%, the ECB considers that institutions should perform, as part of the independent review and validation, a sensitivity analysis for the IRC and the default risk in the IRC. In particular, the ECB understands that this requirement implies assessing the sensitivity of the IRC and default risk in the IRC amounts by assigning one rating grade higher and one rating grade lower than the one used in the fallback PD assigned on the basis of paragraph 164.$^{87}$|184

In accordance with Article 372(a) of the CRR, the IRC model must provide accurate and consistent estimates of incremental default risk. Therefore, the ECB considers that the market value change following the default of an issuer should be calculated as the difference between the current market value of the position and the expected market value subsequent to default.|114

In accordance with Article 372(a) of the CRR, the IRC model must provide a meaningful differentiation of risk. In accordance with Article 375(1) of the CRR, institutions must reflect the potential for significant basis risks in hedging strategies by product, seniority in the capital structure, internal or external rating, maturity, vintage and other differences in the instruments. The ECB considers that in order to provide a meaningful differentiation of risk and to reflect the potential for significant basis risks, recovery rates should at least reflect the type of product, including the collateralisation of the position, and its seniority in the capital structure.|175
2541|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 169|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.5 Ratings, probabilities of default and recovery rate assumptions > 6.5.5 Requirements for the calculation of losses based on recovery rates|169. In accordance with Article 372(a) of the CRR, the IRC model must provide accurate and consistent estimates of incremental default risk. In accordance with Article 372(d) in conjunction with Article 369(1) of the CRR, institutions must demonstrate that any assumptions made within the IRC model are appropriate. The ECB considers that this applies also to RRs. An RR measures the expected market value subsequent to default of a position as a percentage of the base value (for example, notional). For a long credit position (for example, the holding of a long bond position) a default of the issuer would lead to a loss. For RRs based on notional value, a negative RR indicates a negative expected market value subsequent to default, whereas an RR above 100% indicates that the expected market value subsequent to default is higher than the notional value. The ECB is aware that RRs generally range between 0% and 100%. RRs outside this range could indicate that the assumptions made within the IRC model are not appropriate - because they could imply an expected profit subsequent to default - and so institutions should be particularly prudent in applying such RRs or be able to demonstrate that they are conservative.|292
2542|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 170|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.6 Treatment of groups of connected issuers|170. In accordance with Article 374(2) of the CRR, the IRC model must appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. As defined in Article 4(1)(39) of the CRR, two or more legal persons in the same group of connected clients constitute a single risk, unless it is shown otherwise. The ECB considers that groups of connected clients are relevant for modelling issuer concentrations. Therefore, such groups should be appropriately reflected in the IRC model and their treatment in the model is subject to the same requirements as any other component of the model, in particular documentation and validation.|144
2543|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 171|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.6 Treatment of groups of connected issuers|171. In accordance with Article 374(2) of the CRR, the IRC model must appropriately reflect issuer concentrations. As defined in Article 4(1)(39) of the CRR, a group of connected clients constitute a single risk, unless it is shown otherwise. Therefore, the ECB considers that institutions should model issuers and obligors in the same group of connected clients as a single risk (this means, for example, that in an asset value model they should be modelled as a single asset value). However, the existence of different rating grades within a group of connected clients indicates the possibility that not all of those in the group default or migrate simultaneously. Therefore, the ECB considers that a suitable method of modelling is to distinguish within a group of connected clients by subgroups of issuers that have the same internal or external rating grade and where the default or migration of each sub-group would occur simultaneously in the IRC model - unless it is demonstrated that another treatment is more appropriate in view of the definition in Article 4(1)(39) of the CRR.|245
2544|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 172|Other|Market risk > 6 Methodology for IRC models focusing on default risk > 6.6 Treatment of groups of connected issuers|172. In accordance with Article 376(3)(a) of the CRR, an institution must, as part of the annual independent review and the initial and periodic validation of its IRC model, validate that its modelling approach for correlations is appropriate for its portfolio. Because modelling groups of connected clients is relevant for modelling issuer concentrations and the correlations among them, the ECB considers that validation of the modelling of groups of connected clients is part of the annual independent review and the initial and periodic validation of the institution's IRC model.|131
2545|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 173|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.2 The framework for risks-not-in-the-model engines|173. In accordance with Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk must capture accurately all material price risks. For IRC models, the accuracy of the risk estimates is also required by Article 372(a) of the CRR. In accordance with Article 367(1)(b) of the CRR, where a risk factor is incorporated into the institution's pricing model but not into the risk measurement model, the institution must be able to justify such an omission to the satisfaction of the competent authority. In accordance with Article 368(2)(d) of the CRR, the annual review of an institution's overall risk management process must consider the scope of risks captured by the risk measurement model. In accordance with Article 369(1) of the CRR, institutions must have processes in place to ensure that all their internal models for market risk have been adequately validated to ensure that they are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks. In accordance with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, the institution must have in place established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of its internal models.|278
2546|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 173|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.2 The framework for risks-not-in-the-model engines|"Based on the provisions referred to above, the ECB considers that the processes set out in detail in this section for risks not captured in the model$^{89}$ engines (also referred to in this guide as ""risks-not-in-the-model engines"", or ""RNIME""$^{90}$) are an integral part of the overall processes of the IMA for market risks. Therefore, institutions should develop an RNIME framework, the elements of which are further elaborated on in the following paragraphs."|125
2547|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 174|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.2 The framework for risks-not-in-the-model engines|"174. For the purposes of this guide and in relation to the RNIME framework, the following diagram shows schematically different components of the market risk own funds requirements and the RNIME framework. 91 The ECB considers that an internal model comprises all of the required methods, processes, policies, controls, and IT systems. Each internal model includes, inter alia, the following constituent elements. 
(a) An ""engine"" - that is, the calculation methodology for each risk number, referred to collectively as ""risk engines"". The ECB understands that Articles 367 and 368 of the CRR refer to an engine as a ""risk measurement model"". There is one risk engine for each risk number and the risk engine is used to compute the daily risk number. Typically, an engine models and computes all risks in an integrated manner. However, it may comprise several components, for example, a main component for the bulk of the risks, and some ""satellite"" components. A satellite component is part of a model engine, typically for a subset of products or risk positions, meeting all applicable CRR requirements for risk measurement models on an ongoing basis (for example, for particular risks not modelled in the main component). In accordance with Article 367(3) of the CRR, institutions may, in any internal model used for market risk, use empirical correlations; where they are not used, the model uses a simple sum aggregation of these components. 
(b) An RNIME framework relating to all risk engines, in which RNIME are identified, quantified, managed and, if appropriate, capitalised by RNIME add-ons to the risk exposure amounts. The process for determining RNIME add-ons is part of the RNIME framework. An RNIME add-on is understood as a temporary risk exposure amount 92 that remains in place until the corresponding RNIME is incorporated into the model engine(s) in a manner compliant with the CRR. The ECB considers that the RNIME add-ons are not part of the model engines, and are therefore not included in the risk numbers. In particular, RNIME add-ons are not included in the VaR number used for regulatory back-testing."|465

2549|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 174|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.2 The framework for risks-not-in-the-model engines|In accordance with Article 363(1) of the CRR, institutions may calculate their own funds requirements for market risk using their internal models instead of, or in combination with, the methods of the standardised approaches for market risk. Because the positions exposed to RNIME according to the process and requirements described in this Section 7 are within the scope of the IMA, they do not need to be accounted for under the standardised approaches for market risk.|118

2551|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 175|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.2 The framework for risks-not-in-the-model engines|175. In accordance with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions must have established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of internal models. Therefore, the ECB considers that an institution should have a policy and controls in place that govern the overall process for the identification, quantification and management of RNIME. In order to enable efficient monitoring of RNIME, the ECB considers that the documented policies should include a description of the different tasks and responsibilities, and the frequency of their execution. This policy and these controls constitute the RNIME framework. The ECB considers that the RNIME framework should cover the tasks described in the following paragraphs of this section.|172
2552|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 176|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.2 The framework for risks-not-in-the-model engines|176. In accordance with Article 368(1)(b) of the CRR, the risk control unit is responsible for the overall risk management system. Because the RNIME framework is an integral part of the overall IMA processes, the ECB considers that the risk control unit is also responsible for the overall RNIME framework.|92
2553|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 176|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.2 The framework for risks-not-in-the-model engines|In accordance with Article 368(1)(b) of the CRR, the risk control unit must conduct the initial and ongoing validation of any internal model for market risk. Therefore, the ECB considers that the RNIME framework and methodologies should be initially and periodically validated internally, and updated if necessary.|86
2554|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 177|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.3 Identification of RNIME|177. A single RNIME identified refers to a distinct risk not accurately captured or omitted, and related to positions or instruments within the approved risk categories in the IMA in the VaR, sVaR, IRC or CRM models. This can refer to a single risk factor, a set of risk factors (e.g. related to a yield curve), a particular effect (e.g. volatility skew) or specific instruments.|107
2555|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 177|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.3 Identification of RNIME|"The ECB considers that RNIME can emerge as a result of the following circumstances. 
(a) Differences in the positions, risk factors and pricing methods captured in VaR, sVaR, and IRC (and CRM if applicable) engines, in comparison with those of the end-of-day valuation process for the books and records of an institution. 93 In particular, these may include risk factors that are taken into account in the economic P&L, but not in the risk measurement model as referred to in Article 367(1)(b) of the CRR."|135
2556|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 177|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.3 Identification of RNIME|"Some examples could be: simplified pricing models or sensitivities based P&L in the risk engines; use of proxies for risk factors; calibration of pricing models in the risk engines; and risks not adequately modelled, such as basis risk between two different classes of shares.

2559|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 178|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.3 Identification of RNIME|178. In accordance with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, an institution must have established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of its internal models. Therefore, the ECB considers that in order to ensure a comprehensive coverage of such risks, the institution should clearly describe and document each RNIME in an inventory, as part of its RNIME framework.|108
2560|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 178|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.3 Identification of RNIME|In order to properly monitor each RNIME, the ECB considers that institutions should explain how each RNIME is identified and defined, and should, in particular, be able to justify the cases where a single RNIME is defined across portfolios or product classes. In order to properly assess materiality, the ECB understands that the current portfolio composition and trading strategy of the institution should be taken into account when assessing each RNIME. The ECB understands that, generally, all RNIME need to be included in the RNIME framework described below. It understands that the only exception is where the institution can demonstrate that the effect of an identified RNIME is negligible in the current portfolio and will remain negligible taking into account the trading strategy, in which case the institution might exclude that RNIME from the RNIME quantification and management processes that are part of the RNIME framework. The institution should be able to provide justification as to why any particular RNIME is not included in its risk engines.|214
2561|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 179|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.3 Identification of RNIME|179. In accordance with Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, any internal model must capture accurately all material price risks. The ECB considers that in order to ensure an accurate capture of risks, institutions should not rely solely on the monitoring of current RNIME, but strive to identify RNIME on an ongoing basis, and as early as possible, as part of the overall risk management. The ECB considers it best practice to use existing processes efficiently to identify RNIME.|119
2562|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 179|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.3 Identification of RNIME|"As part of such best practice, and in order to maximise efficiency, institutions should, at a minimum, use the following processes to identify RNIME: 
(a) a review of the institution's trading strategy, as referred to in Article 103(2) of the CRR, considering, in particular, the expansion and reorientation of the trading business, given that expanding a particular business could lead to RNIME becoming significant, or to additional risks that are not currently covered in the RNIME process; 
(b) the regulatory back-testing process, as referred to in Article 366 of the CRR, as part of which the institution should review the results and analyses of overshootings in order to identify RNIME; 
(c) market data quality assurance processes for risk factors, as referred to in Article 367(2)(e) of the CRR, where market data display insufficient quality; 
(d) initial and ongoing internal validation of internal models, as referred to in Articles 368(1)(b) and 369(1) of the CRR, at least where differences between the institution's pricing model and risk measurement model are identified (for example, risk factors that are used for the valuation of a product for the end-of-day valuation process, but not for risk measurement), and where internal back-testing shows a high number of overshootings; 
(e) introduction of new products, where the institution should analyse whether the market risks inherent in the new products and their related trading strategies can be adequately captured by the risk engines in order to ensure that these new products - which may pose additional risk factors or require methodological changes - are fully compatible with the comprehensive risk control and validation by the risk control unit, as required by Article 368(1)(b) of the CRR."|385
2563|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 179|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.3 Identification of RNIME|In accordance with Article 368(2)(d) of the CRR, the annual review of an institution's overall risk management process must consider the scope of risks captured by the risk measurement model. Therefore, the ECB considers that a review of the inventory of RNIME should be carried out at least once a year.|85
2564|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 180|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.4 Quantification of RNIME|180. In accordance with Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk must capture accurately all material price risks. In order to ensure a meaningful quantification of RNIME in relation to the internal models, the ECB considers that the risk parameters for RNIME quantification should be aligned to the regulatory specifications. Therefore, the quantification of risks-not-in-the-VaR engine should aim to reflect a loss at a 99% confidence level and a holding period of ten days. Similarly, the quantification of risks-not-in-the-sVaR engine should aim to reflect a loss at a 99% confidence level and a holding period of ten days, and be calibrated to historical data from the stressed period used to calibrate the sVaR model. The quantification of risks-not-in-the-IRC engine (or CRM engine, if applicable) should aim to reflect a loss at a 99.9% confidence interval over a time horizon of one year.|230
2565|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 181|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.4 Quantification of RNIME|181. In accordance with Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk must capture accurately all material price risks. Therefore, the ECB considers that in order to ensure that the internal models capture all material price risks, institutions should quantify RNIME in an appropriate way and document and duly justify the methodology applied. The ECB understands that the quantification of the impact of the identified i-th RNIME (denoted by RNIME$_{𝑖}$) serves to assess the need to incorporate the i-th RNIME into the engine.|144
2566|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 181|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.4 Quantification of RNIME|The ECB considers it best practice that for each RNIME$_{𝑖}$ identified, the impact quantification $_{𝑀}$$_{𝑖}$ should be estimated as the incremental risk number 94 where RNIME$_{𝑖}$ would be incorporated into the model engine; this is in comparison with the current engine using the same portfolio as reference,|99

2571|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 181|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.4 Quantification of RNIME|Because the impact quantification should allow the different RNIME to be assessed individually, no diversification effect should be applied between different RNIME when quantifying the individual RNIME.|57
2572|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 182|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.4 Quantification of RNIME|182. The ECB considers that a more conservative impact quantification than described in paragraph 181 could be used where this is duly justified. In particular, where an appropriate impact quantification using an incremental risk number cannot be performed, the ECB considers it a prudent approach to resort to a stand-alone impact estimation for RNIME$_{𝑖}$,|93

In accordance with Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, any internal model used to calculate capital requirements for market risk must capture accurately all material price risks. The ECB considers that in order to ensure that the quantification of RNIME is appropriately accurate, the quantification should, where possible, make use of objective market data, even if the data quality is not sufficient to model these risks in the model engine.|111

Differences in the observation period should be duly justified. If scarce data are used to calibrate these shocks, the shocks should be estimated conservatively.

Therefore, the ECB considers that in order to ensure that the models accurately capture all material price risks including RNIME and thereby result in a sufficient level of own funds, institutions should take into account all of the following points. 
(a) An RNIME$_{𝑖}$, where $_{𝑀}$$_{𝑖}$ < 0 does not allow the reduction of own funds requirements until the related risk has been incorporated into the relevant engine.

In so doing they should take into account the multiplication factors ($_{m}$$_{c}$) and ($_{m}$$_{s}$) for VaR and sVaR as referred to in Article 366 of the CRR without the back-testing addend, until they have incorporated it into the engine affected. Consistent with the impact quantification, the ECB considers that there should not be any diversification effect between different RNIME add-ons. 
(c) Institutions should determine, at their own discretion, thresholds above which RNIME are incorporated into the model engines."|218
2591|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 186|Other|Market risk > 7 Risks-not-in-the-model engines > 7.5 Management of RNIME and implementation in an institution's risk engines|In accordance with Article 7a(1)(c)(ii) of the Commission Delegated Regulation on materiality of extensions and changes of the IMA, a change of 10% or more of a relevant risk VaR, sVaR, IRC, or CRM number is to be considered a material change to the IMA. Therefore, the ECB considers, by analogy, that if the cumulative RNIME impact corresponds to more than 10% of the amount computed by the risk engine, this indicates that an engine might not capture accurately all material price risks, 97 as the change needed to incorporate them into the engine could amount to a material model change.|164

(d) The ECB considers it a prudent approach that RNIME which are to be incorporated into the relevant engine(s) are capitalised with RNIME add-ons as part of the implementation plan, until they are incorporated into the relevant engine(s).

With reference to the previous paragraphs in this Section 7.5, the incorporation of RNIME into the model engine should be performed so that the engine complies with all relevant requirements of the CRR including, in particular, internal validation. The term ""incorporation"" here means the integration of RNIME into the relevant risk engine, and into its methodology and processes, typically allowing for risk diversification.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide transparency on how the ECB understands a number of topics related to the principles defined for the Internal Model Method (IMM$^{1}$, as referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 6 of the CRR). This chapter does not contain an exhaustive list of topics relevant for compliance with IMM requirements that could be subject to review during future internal model investigations.$^{2}$|107
2607|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 2|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 1 Scope of the counterparty credit risk chapter|2. In the understanding of the ECB and in order to comply with Article 6(1) of the CRR, all requirements of Part III Title 2 Chapter 6 Section 6 must also be met by all legal entities that have approval to use the IMM for solo capital requirement calculations. This is especially important when underlying portfolios differ and the portfolio at consolidated level is not representative of that at the solo level. In particular, these requirements are relevant for stress period determination in accordance with Article 292(3) of the CRR and for all validation requirements when selecting, for example, relevant risk factors and synthetic portfolios for back-testing.|145

(b) Article 273(6) of the CRR requires, for all methods in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Sections 3 to 6 of the CRR (Articles 274 to 294), that the exposure value for a given counterparty is calculated as the sum of exposure values, calculated for each netting set with that counterparty. However, these provisions do not explicitly address the case of synthetic netting sets arising from the splitting of a contractual netting set."|212

(d) Article 294(1)(l) of the CRR requires that pricing functions be tested against an appropriate independent benchmark. 
(e) Article 294(1)(o) of the CRR requires, in a general way and without further explanation, that validation ""shall assess whether or not the counterparty level and netting set exposure calculations … are appropriate"". 
(f) According to Article 293(4) of the CRR, any ""institution shall define criteria with which to assess its CCR exposure models and the models that input into the calculation of exposure and maintain a written policy that describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be identified and remedied"".

2615|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 9|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|9. With regard to the coverage of the IMM, institutions should comply with Section II, Chapter 3, paragraph 8 of the ECB Guide on options and discretions available in Union law, where the IMM coverage mentioned covers transactions treated under the method described in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 6 of the CRR. Transactions treated under any non-IMM method are, however, excluded. In particular, transactions which are carved out from the IMM are excluded from the IMM coverage.|124

For cases where, for a given legally enforceable netting agreement as defined in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 7 of the CRR, one part of the transactions is treated under the method described in Section 6 (IMM) and another part is covered by one of the non-IMM methods$^{5}$, the ECB considers, as a best practice, the creation of different synthetic netting sets, one per method. Hence, one synthetic netting set covers all the transactions under the IMM, and the other synthetic netting sets cover all the transactions under each non-IMM method (one per non-IMM method).|159
2617|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 11|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|11. It is the ECB's understanding that synthetic netting sets created for the purposes described in paragraph 10 should cover only transactions under the same contractual netting agreement; that is, Article 273(6) of the CRR (netting set-specific application of any CCR method) is understood to apply also to synthetic netting sets.|91
2618|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 12|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"12. In relation to the requirement provided for by Article 294(1)(l) of the CRR 6 and in accordance with Article 294(1)(d) of the CRR, it is the ECB's understanding that institutions should implement a framework that enables them to identify significant pricing model deficiencies at transaction level. It is considered as best practice to apply at least the following filter criteria to ensure the consistent identification of such deficiencies (in accordance with Article 294(1)(o) of the CRR) when comparing the IMM transaction's $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ value and the respective benchmark value: 
(a) a threshold based on the absolute price difference; 
(b) a threshold for differences expressed as a percentage of the notional amount; 
(c) a threshold for differences expressed as a percentage of the absolute value of the respective benchmark."|198
2619|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 12|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|The institution should be able to justify the setting of the above filter criteria, which should be regularly validated and defined so that unacceptable model performance as set out in Article 293(4) of the CRR can be assessed, especially for pricing.|69
2620|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 13|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"13. The ECB considers that appropriate measures to address identified model weaknesses as referred to in the above assessment are as follows. 
(a) A carve-out of transactions to one of the non-IMM methods, together with the creation of synthetic netting sets to remedy unacceptable performance of the CCR exposure model in accordance with Article 293(4) in conjunction with Article 294(1)(d) of the CRR. This is proposed provided that one of the identified price differences referred to in paragraph 12 is observed for longer than the number of business days that is pre-defined by the institution for this case. The ECB considers it best practice that this number is limited to ten business days during the reference quarter. 
(b) Measures other than carve-outs and the creation of synthetic netting sets that could be applied to address model deficiencies, provided that these other measures (i) can be justified, (ii) are regularly validated, and (iii) meet the purpose set out in Article 294(1)(d) of the CRR of not systematically underestimating exposure, in conjunction with the purpose of Article 293(4) of the CRR of identifying and remedying unacceptable exposure model performance."|265
2621|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 13|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|This includes, in the ECB's understanding as further explained in paragraph 81, that institutions should take all necessary remediation actions to solve the root causes creating the most significant differences between the values of pricing functions used for revaluation under the IMM and the respective benchmarking value in a timely manner.|79
2622|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 14|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"14. For all transactions that have been identified according to the assessment described in paragraph 12 and that remain in the IMM because they have not been carved out to address identified model weaknesses in accordance with paragraph 13(a), it is the ECB's understanding that the differences between the 𝑡$_{0}$ transaction values and the benchmarks as referred to in Article 294(1)(l) of the CRR should be taken into account. For such transactions, the ECB regards the following corrections as appropriate measures to remedy weaknesses in the exposure calculation as a result of pricing model deficiencies in accordance with Article 293(4) of the CRR. 
(a) At $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$, IMM transaction values are adjusted to match the respective benchmark value. 
(b) At future grid points, an adjustment to the modelling of the transaction's future values is applied in such a way that the EEPE of the netting set after correction is not lower than that without any correction. Rather than using the observed difference at $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$, the correction could be estimated using more sophisticated methods, taking future market scenarios and amortising transactions into account."|262

2624|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 15|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|15. The ECB may see it as a violation of Article 292(1) CRR if the price differences as identified in accordance with paragraph 12 (i) are persistent, (ii) do not lead to remediation of model deficiencies and (iii) lead to a systematic underestimation of exposure, In such cases, the ECB may consider supervisory measures regarding affected transaction types.|100
2625|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 16|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|16. In the ECB's understanding, transactions carved out as a result, for example, of price differences with a benchmarking system should not be considered as contributing to the required IMM coverage explained in Section II, Chapter 3, paragraph 8 of the ECB Guide on options and discretions available in Union law.|84
2626|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 17|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 2 Trade coverage > 2.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"17. The ECB considers it best practice to perform a full simulation in accordance with paragraph 5 for all IMM transactions to directly comply with the requirements of Article 284(1) of the CRR. In cases where this practice is not feasible, the ECB considers that the following approach would still be compliant with the CRR: 
(a) if other (approximate) pricing methods are used, they should be subject to the validation requirements described in paragraphs 81 and 83(a) to 83(c); 
(b) if any alternative way to calculate exposures 7 is used, then the following points should be taken into account along with the validation requirements described in paragraphs 81 and 83(d). 
(i) The institution should be able to demonstrate that the sole reason for using this exposure calculation method is pricing performance, or a performance issue related to calibrating certain transaction-specific risk factors. For example, including these transactions in a full simulation in accordance with paragraph 5 would delay regulatory reporting by more than one business day. 
(ii) Correlations with the other risk factors simulated in the CCR exposure model should be taken into account when calculating or calibrating such exposures. This would also hold in the case of new or aggregated risk factors only used for this exposure calculation method. 
(iii) The underlying risk factor simulation should account for the exposure time dependency, in particular for margined trading regarding the time grid point to which the margin period of risk (MPOR) is attached. 
(iv) This exposure calculation method should account for potential traderelated cash flows (CFs) during the MPOR, either directly or in such a way as to avoid systematic underestimation of the exposure. 
(v) Pricing functions used for the purpose of calculating or calibrating the current exposure of affected transactions should be an explicit part of the IMM framework and governance. 
(vi) The sum of the absolute $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ values of these transactions is below 20% 8 of the total sum of absolute $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ values from all transactions covered by the IMM."|454
2627|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 18|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows|"18. This section refers to the modelling of the MPOR, 9 including the following aspects. 
(a) Treatment of margin call and trade-related CFs in all currencies. The trade-related CFs include here both intermediary flows and the settlements at maturity related to trades, as well as flows in the form of a commodity or precious metal or any other asset that may be paid/received during the MPOR. Trade-related CFs paid by the institution to the counterparty result in upward jumps of the exposure time profile (hereinafter called ""spikes""). 
(b) Taking the default management process (DMP) into account when modelling CFs paid/received during the MPOR. The DMP refers to all legal and operational actions performed by the institution upon counterparty default before the institution stops paying margin call and trade-related CFs to the defaulted counterparty. 
(c) Interpolation techniques that may be applied to estimate the netting set market value at MPOR time points that do not belong to the simulation time grid used. 
(d) Mapping between each time grid point t, for which EE(t) is calculated, and the associated MPOR.$^{10}$ 
(e) Clarifying the term ""most recent exchange of collateral"" regarding the definition of the MPOR and thus specifying the point in time in the modelling when the MPOR starts. 
(f) The concepts of ""illiquid collateral"", of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that ""cannot be easily replaced"" in the context of ""stressed market conditions"", and of ""concentration"" of transactions or securities in a particular counterparty."|342
2628|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 19|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.1 Relevant regulatory references|"19. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are the following. 
(a) Article 292(1)(a) of the CRR, which requires the model to reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, complete and conservative fashion, but does not make explicit mention of trade-related CFs. 
(b) Article 292(1)(b) of the CRR, which requires that netting agreements (including actions upon counterparty default or outstanding payments of the counterparty as part of netting arrangements) be reflected. 
(c) Article 289(5) of the CRR, which notably provides that an ""institution shall estimate EE along a time profile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future CFs and maturity of the contracts and in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposures"". However, modelling within the MPOR is not explicitly mentioned. 
(d) Article 272(9) of the CRR, which provides a definition of the MPOR: ""'margin period of risk' means the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterparty until the transactions are closed out and the resulting market risk is re-hedged"". However, this definition does not mention the trade-related CFs. Furthermore, it is not explicitly stated whether the most recent exchange of collateral refers to the time when the margin amount is called or the time of the final settlement after the collateral is received. 
(e) Article 284(4) of the CRR, which specifies how to use the alpha parameter, mentioning that competent authorities may require a higher one than 1.4. 
(f) Article 294(1)(g) of the CRR, which notably requires the validation of transaction-specific information to capture the effects of margining in the model, and Article 294(1)(i) of the CRR, which requires the testing of key assumptions of the CCR exposure model, without mentioning explicitly advanced features in MPOR and CF modelling, such as the use of"|452
2629|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 19|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.1 Relevant regulatory references|"""Brownian Bridge""-based interpolation for additional time grid points in the MPOR. 
(g) According to Article 284(1) of the CRR, the exposure value needs to be calculated ""on the basis of joint changes in relevant market variables"". It does not give explicit details regarding the starting point in time of these changes. 
(h) Article 285(2) to (5) of the CRR sets the length of the MPOR. There is no special provision for its length if the MPOR is attached to (i) time grid points $_{𝑡}$ after $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ but before $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ plus the MPOR length or (ii) time grid points at the end of the exposure time axis with $_{𝑡}$ plus MPOR being later than the one-year horizon or later than the final maturity of the netting set. 
(i) According to Article 284(4) of the CRR, the ""model shall estimate EE at a series of future dates t1, t2, t3, etc."" The article does not specify for margined trading in which way an MPOR needs to be attached to these future dates, in particular concerning attachments close to $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ and close to the one-year future date or the final maturity of the netting set. 
(j) Article 285(3) of the CRR provides for two exceptions for the calculation of the MPOR for transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-tomarket valuation, namely (i) if the number of trades exceeds 5,000 at any point during a quarter, or (ii) if a netting set contains one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced. In these two cases, the MPOR must not be less than 20 business days. The provision provides for the following two obligations in this context. 
(i) Institutions must determine whether collateral is illiquid or whether OTC derivatives cannot be easily replaced in the context of stressed market conditions, characterised by the absence of continuously active markets where a counterparty would, within two days or fewer, obtain multiple price quotations that would, however, not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market discount for collateral or a premium for OTC derivatives. 
(ii) Institutions must also consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and, if that counterparty exited the market precipitously, whether the institution would be able to replace those trades or securities."|559
2630|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 20|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"20. The requirements of Articles 292(1)(a) and 289(5) of the CRR are also seen as being applicable to the modelling of exposure changes of margined trading within the MPOR. The term ""margin arrangement"", as mentioned in Article 292(1)(b) of the CRR, is understood as comprising all contractual features, the margining mechanism with margin call triggers, grace periods and close-out provisions, which, according to Article 292(1)(a) of the CRR, must be reflected in the model. 
(a) In the view of the ECB, with regard to the modelling of margin call and trade-related CFs within the MPOR, Article 272(9) of the CRR should be understood as requiring that none of these CFs be received from the counterparty after the beginning of the MPOR. An institution may receive trade-related CFs after the beginning of the MPOR only if it can justify that its assumptions are consistent with its modelling of default time within the MPOR, its DMP and its assumptions regarding non-payment of CFs.$^{11}$ 
(b) Furthermore, the counterparty is supposed to default at some time point during the MPOR, and non-payment of trade-related CFs to the defaulting counterparty may be assumed to the extent that this assumption is consistent with: 
(i) the DMP and the features of enforceable settlement mechanisms (e.g. agreements to net CFs with related margin calls or analogues to the Continuous Linked Settlement system); 
(ii) the grace period and close-out requirements specified in the netting agreement, and in particular how the close-out is affected by paid or non-paid CFs."|374
2631|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 20|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"It is considered best practice and cautious modelling (for example, given that watchlists of critical counterparties include only a subset of all potentially critical counterparties) that trade-related CFs from the institution to the counterparty that are due according to the underlying contract are assumed to be paid at least for a time period after the beginning of the MPOR corresponding to the re-margining period. 
(c) If the institution has no defined DMP or the DMP is not taken into account in the modelling, all trade-related CFs due by the institution should be assumed to be paid to the counterparty during the whole MPOR. 
(d) Assuming that there are documented and enforceable settlement netting rules, the aggregation of netting set CFs with opposite signs falling due on the same date from different legs of the same transactions and/or from other transactions in the netting set could be integrated into the modelling of CFs within the MPOR. The resulting net CF should be treated in accordance with points 20(a) and 20(b). 
(e) A modelling different from the expected modelling described above showing discrepancies with the DMP could be accepted if it is shown that the quantitative impact of this approach on the EEPE is not material."|275
2632|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 21|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|21. If (i) an institution does not comply with the requirements of Articles 292(1)(a) and 289(5) of the CRR as explained in paragraphs 20(a)-20(d) above, and (ii) there is a material impact as referred to in paragraph 20(e), the ECB has the power to impose an appropriate and proportionate supervisory remediation measure, which can consist - as provided for by Article 284(4) of the CRR - in an increase of the alpha parameter.|135
2633|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 22|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|22. MPOR modelling may require the estimation of netting set market values at time points that do not belong to the simulation time grid. It is the ECB's understanding of Article 294(1)(g) of the CRR that interpolation/extrapolation techniques 12 used by institutions to perform such estimations should be validated by studies showing that impacts on the EEPE, compared with full revaluation, are not material.|113
2634|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 23|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"23. In the view of the ECB, backward 13 and forward 14 modelling of the MPOR setting, as well as a mix of both$^{15}$, can be considered CRR-compliant. In particular the following holds. 
(a) Backward modelling approach:"|83
2635|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 23|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|For time grid points t falling within the interval [ 𝑡$_{0}$, 𝑡$_{0}$ + 𝑀𝑃𝑂𝑅 ] , institutions should calculate expected exposure $_{𝐸𝐸 (𝑡)}$) as required in Article 284(4) of the CRR by modelling joint changes in relevant market variables mentioned in Article 284(1)(b) of the CRR starting from $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$, since Article 284(5) of the CRR defines this date as the earliest date for the calculation of exposure.|157
2636|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 23|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|When using the forward modelling approach, institutions should calculate expected exposure $_{𝐸𝐸 (𝑡)}$) as required by Article 284(4) of the CRR by taking into account close-out amounts that are determined after $_{𝑡}$ within the MPOR period as given by Article 285(2) to (5) of the CRR. This also applies when $_{𝑡}$ ∈ [ 1𝑦 - 𝑀𝑃𝑂𝑅, 1𝑦 ] , i.e. for such a $_{𝑡}$, $_{𝑡}$ + 𝑀𝑃𝑂𝑅 ≥ $_{1𝑦}$ holds.|185
2637|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 23|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|Furthermore, if $_{𝑡}$ equals the maturity ($_{𝑇}$), of the longest-lasting transaction in the netting set, and if no collateral is modelled as held by the institution at $_{𝑇}$ for a given scenario, the effective length of the MPOR may shorten, as no close-out or re-hedging is due after maturity of the last transaction in the netting set.|112
2638|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 23|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|The ECB understands that the effective length of the MPOR for these grid points may be shortened and considers that this will not affect the formal length of the MPOR as provided for by Article 285(2) to (5) of the CRR.|76
2639|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 24|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"24. In the view of the ECB, the term ""exchange of collateral"" in Article 272(9) of the CRR means that the margin call has been issued and has a high probability of being completed, or is expected to be completed, even if the collateral called actually arrives only after the start of the MPOR. This understanding implies that the default time is not necessarily immediately at the start of the MPOR but could occur at a later point in time. For modelling purposes, it may still be assumed that collateral will be delivered for margin calls issued at the time the MPOR starts or earlier. Furthermore, this understanding implies that changes in value that arise after a margin call is issued and that affect both collateral and underlying transactions in the collateral agreement can happen within the full MPOR."|186
2640|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 25|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"25. Where a netting set contains one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, the ECB considers that the correct application of Article 285(3)(b) of the CRR should imply that the following items are defined and determined by each institution based on its portfolio and market data history: 
(a) illiquid collateral, which includes the collateral legs of securities financing transactions (SFTs); 
(b) OTC derivatives that cannot be easily replaced (hereinafter referred to as ""hard-to-replace transactions""); 
(c) trades or securities that are held as collateral, concentrated in a particular counterparty; 
(d) stressed market conditions."|168
2641|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 25|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|This means that institutions should implement processes to reliably identify the securities or transactions concerned and the related netting sets, and to monitor them.|52

In establishing the definitions of the items mentioned in paragraph 25(a) to (c) above, along with the related processes, the ECB considers it best practice if an institution considers, for each counterparty, the following features and attributes of transactions and collateral, beside others, as possible determinants of illiquidity or concentration: 
(a) For illiquid collateral and hard-to-replace transactions: 
(i) product type, underlying asset(s) and complexity (e.g. pathdependent features, payoffs in different currencies or multiple underlyings, etc.)$^{16}$; 
(ii) accounting classification$^{17}$; 
(iii) clearing$^{18}$;

(ix) type(s) 20 of underlying$^{21}$; 
(x) liquidation cost.$^{22}$ 
(b) For illiquid collateral in addition to point (a) above: 
(i) security type and categorisation as a ""liquid asset"" under Article 416 of the CRR; 
(ii) time period (number of business days) since the most recent market price 23 was observed; 
(iii) issuer's financial health (based, for instance, on its external rating and recent public information). 
(c) For the concentration of transactions or of collateral in one counterparty: 
(i) for derivative transactions, the sensitivity to main risk factors (as defined by the institution), or the notional amount or mark-to-market value, whichever is more appropriate for the type of transaction; 
(ii) for a security that is part of an SFT or received variation margin, the notional amount or mark-to-market value of the security posted to the institution should be compared with the same security's trading volume in the market; 
(iii) items (i) and (ii) should also take into account cases where the concentrated transaction or collateral might be hard to replace or illiquid under stressed market conditions."|290

For the purpose of potential MPOR extensions, the illiquid collateral and hardto-replace transactions need to be identified under normal market conditions and under stressed market conditions. In order to derive conditions that characterise stressed market conditions as defined in Article 285(3) second sub-paragraph of the CRR, the ECB sees benefit in establishing processes and methodologies that: 
(a) analyse the available market data history on a regular basis in order to identify historical events leading to conditions where the market for a certain derivative or collateral cannot be considered as continuously active; 
(b) where relevant$^{24}$, alternatively or additionally consider potential future situations that could affect the replaceability of transactions and/or the liquidity of collateral, in order to anticipate potentially reduced market depth and/or liquidity under future extreme but plausible economic scenarios based on justified expert opinions."|195
2646|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 28|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"28. For the purpose of paragraph 27, the ECB sees benefit in defining and determining conditions under which: 
(a) no prices for collateral or the relevant transactions can be obtained; 
(b) prices are unchanged (stale) for a number of consecutive days in markets where prices normally change more frequently; 
(c) smaller (local) but usually active markets - where the institution has no chance to ""sidestep"" to another market - could be subject to marketspecific stress events that affect the replaceability of transactions and/or the liquidity of collateral traded on these markets."|142

The ECB sees benefit in developing documented methodologies, including filter criteria, detailed identification of algorithms, etc., on the following: 
(a) how to use the features and attributes mentioned in paragraph 26, in particular for assessing market liquidity and potential concentrations regarding transactions and collateral with a given counterparty; 
(b) how historical events of market stress or reduced liquidity as mentioned in paragraph 27(a) are identified to the extent historical analysis is used;

2659|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 24|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"24. In the view of the ECB, the term ""exchange of collateral"" in Article 272(9) of the CRR means that the margin call has been issued and has a high probability of being completed, or is expected to be completed, even if the collateral called actually arrives only after the start of the MPOR. This understanding implies that the default time is not necessarily immediately at the start of the MPOR but could occur at a later point in time. For modelling purposes, it may still be assumed that collateral will be delivered for margin calls issued at the time the MPOR starts or earlier. Furthermore, this understanding implies that changes in value that arise after a margin call is issued and that affect both collateral and underlying transactions in the collateral agreement can happen within the full MPOR."|186
2660|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 25|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"25. Where a netting set contains one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, the ECB considers that the correct application of Article 285(3)(b) of the CRR should imply that the following items are defined and determined by each institution based on its portfolio and market data history: 
(a) illiquid collateral, which includes the collateral legs of securities financing transactions (SFTs); 
(b) OTC derivatives that cannot be easily replaced (hereinafter referred to as ""hard-to-replace transactions""); 
(c) trades or securities that are held as collateral, concentrated in a particular counterparty; 
(d) stressed market conditions."|168
2661|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 25|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|This means that institutions should implement processes to reliably identify the securities or transactions concerned and the related netting sets, and to monitor them.|52
2662|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 26|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"26. In establishing the definitions of the items mentioned in paragraph 25(a) to (c) above, along with the related processes, the ECB considers it best practice if an institution considers, for each counterparty, the following features and attributes of transactions and collateral, beside others, as possible determinants of illiquidity or concentration: 
(a) For illiquid collateral and hard-to-replace transactions: 
(i) product type, underlying asset(s) and complexity (e.g. pathdependent features, payoffs in different currencies or multiple underlyings, etc.)$^{16}$; 
(ii) accounting classification$^{17}$; 
(iii) clearing$^{18}$; 
(iv) currency;

(ix) type(s) 20 of underlying$^{21}$; 
(x) liquidation cost.$^{22}$ 
(b) For illiquid collateral in addition to point (a) above: 
(i) security type and categorisation as a ""liquid asset"" under Article 416 of the CRR; 
(ii) time period (number of business days) since the most recent market price 23 was observed; 
(iii) issuer's financial health (based, for instance, on its external rating and recent public information). 
(c) For the concentration of transactions or of collateral in one counterparty: 
(i) for derivative transactions, the sensitivity to main risk factors (as defined by the institution), or the notional amount or mark-to-market value, whichever is more appropriate for the type of transaction; 
(ii) for a security that is part of an SFT or received variation margin, the notional amount or mark-to-market value of the security posted to the institution should be compared with the same security's trading volume in the market; 
(iii) items (i) and (ii) should also take into account cases where the concentrated transaction or collateral might be hard to replace or illiquid under stressed market conditions."|290
2665|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 27|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"27. For the purpose of potential MPOR extensions, the illiquid collateral and hardto-replace transactions need to be identified under normal market conditions and under stressed market conditions. In order to derive conditions that characterise stressed market conditions as defined in Article 285(3) second sub-paragraph of the CRR, the ECB sees benefit in establishing processes and methodologies that: 
(a) analyse the available market data history on a regular basis in order to identify historical events leading to conditions where the market for a certain derivative or collateral cannot be considered as continuously active; 
(b) where relevant$^{24}$, alternatively or additionally consider potential future situations that could affect the replaceability of transactions and/or the liquidity of collateral, in order to anticipate potentially reduced market depth and/or liquidity under future extreme but plausible economic scenarios based on justified expert opinions."|195
2666|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 28|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"28. For the purpose of paragraph 27, the ECB sees benefit in defining and determining conditions under which: 
(a) no prices for collateral or the relevant transactions can be obtained; 
(b) prices are unchanged (stale) for a number of consecutive days in markets where prices normally change more frequently; 
(c) smaller (local) but usually active markets - where the institution has no chance to ""sidestep"" to another market - could be subject to marketspecific stress events that affect the replaceability of transactions and/or the liquidity of collateral traded on these markets."|142
2667|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 29|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"29. The ECB sees benefit in developing documented methodologies, including filter criteria, detailed identification of algorithms, etc., on the following: 
(a) how to use the features and attributes mentioned in paragraph 26, in particular for assessing market liquidity and potential concentrations regarding transactions and collateral with a given counterparty; 
(b) how historical events of market stress or reduced liquidity as mentioned in paragraph 27(a) are identified to the extent historical analysis is used; 
(c) how stressed market conditions can be anticipated from future extreme but plausible economic scenarios as mentioned in paragraph 27(b), using expert opinions; 
(d) how available data (e.g. bid-offer spread, volatilities, sensitivities, traded market volumes, etc., including from external data sources) are taken into account, potentially complemented by expert judgement$^{25}$, if necessary."|199
2668|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 29|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|In order to derive sound qualitative and quantitative criteria to determine hardto-replace transactions and illiquid collateral under stressed and non-stressed market conditions, these methodologies, as well as the list of features and attributes to be monitored to identify these transactions and collateral (which may go beyond those set out in paragraph 26 above) should be subject to internal validation.|96
2669|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 30|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 3 Margin period of risk and cash flows > 3.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"30. Finally, and independently from the issue of a potential MPOR extension, the ECB sees benefit in monitoring on an ongoing basis, from the overall institution's portfolio perspective: 
(a) the size of hard-to-replace transactions and illiquid collateral; 
(b) the size of concentration in a single counterparty as set out in paragraph 26(c) above."|100
2670|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 31|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling|31. This section deals with the modelling of cash and non-cash margin collateral, that is, its potential value changes from the time when the last margin call at the beginning of the MPOR is settled up to the end of the MPOR. Initial margin (IM) modelling is addressed in Section 5.|74
2671|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 32|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.1 Relevant regulatory references|"32. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are the following. 
(a) Article 292(1) of the CRR requires an institution to ensure the integrity of its modelling process by reflecting, among other things, transaction terms and specifications, which also include margining arrangements. However, it does not further specify how the future collateral composition or a reflection of the actual collateral balance in the IMM's estimated exposure for a netting set should be reflected in the IMM's assumptions. 
(b) Article 285(1), (6) and (7) of the CRR clarifies the modelling options under which the effects of margining can be directly recognised in the exposure value calculation. 
(i) However, these provisions do not determine whether institutions should model margin collateral in a manner consistent with the modelling of securities underlying OTC derivatives and SFTs$^{26}$, or whether they are allowed to adopt a different modelling approach for margin collateral, on the one hand, and securities underlying the different transactions, on the other. 
(ii) The provisions of Article 285(6) of the CRR leave room for interpretation regarding the term ""jointly modelled"". 
(iii) The wording of Article 285(7) 27 of the CRR leads to the conclusion that this article provides an exemption to Article 285(6) of the CRR in cases where an institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure. In this case, and in accordance with Article 285(7) of the CRR, the institution is allowed to use volatility adjustments to recognise the effects of margining in the exposure calculation directly such that the institution does not have to apply one of the EEPE calculation measures presented in Article 285(1)(a) or (b) of the CRR. 
(iv) In addition, Article 285(1), (6) and (7) of the CRR is not specific about whether a combination of the two options (use of volatility adjustments and joint modelling) to account for margining effects is possible. Thus, it is not clear if it is possible to use volatility adjustments in line with Article 285(7) of the CRR, together with the jointly modelled risk factors in accordance with Article 285(6) of the CRR, for the collateral modelling in cases where, for some risk factors, the institution is able to model some collateral components jointly. 
(c) Article 285(7) of the CRR refers to the standards of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method (as set out in Article 223 of the CRR, which refers to Articles 224 to 227 of the CRR) in cases where an institution wants to make use of volatility adjustments to recognise the effect of margining directly in its exposure calculation. Article 223(1) third sub-paragraph of the CRR requires institutions to apply a volatility adjustment to reflect mismatches between the collateral currency and the settlement currency for OTC derivative transactions covered by recognised netting agreements. However, Article 223(1) third sub-paragraph of the CRR neither defines exactly what the settlement currency is, nor its relationship with the currency in which the exposure is denominated in the context of netting sets with attached margin agreements. In addition, the case of these currencies being different from the reporting currency is not treated explicitly."|709
2672|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 33|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|33. The ECB sees as a best practice that non-cash margin collateral is treated in a manner that is consistent with the modelling of securities underlying OTC or SFT transactions, provided that these transactions are within the scope of the IMM. For example, if a certain type of security is fully simulated (or if a volatility adjustment is applied) in the security leg of an SFT, then it should also be fully simulated (or a volatility adjustment should also be applied) if it occurs as margin collateral within the IMM. In the case of inconsistent treatment, the ECB sees it as beneficial that the institution is able to justify this choice and to demonstrate that (i) its approach does not systematically underestimate exposures and (ii) the quantitative impact on the final EEPE is not material.|179
2673|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 34|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"34. In order to comply with the requirements laid down by Article 292(1)(a) and (b) of the CRR with respect to the terms of margining and netting arrangements, the ECB is of the view that the future composition of the collateral pool over the lifetime of the netting set should reflect one or more of the following: 
(a) the contractual arrangements in terms of eligible margin collateral; 
(b) the institution's policy as regards posted collateral types 28 being eligible; 
(c) the composition observed historically;$^{29}$ 
(d) at least the current composition of the margin collateral pool."|149
2674|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 34|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|This holds for the same or similar characteristics of these collateral types.|34
2675|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 35|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|35. When a contractual margin agreement contains transactions treated under both the IMM and a non-IMM method and therefore the contractual netting set is split into different synthetic netting sets, and if collateral modelling uses the actual collateral balance at $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$, the ECB considers that the actual margin collateral should be assigned to the synthetic netting sets. This should be done in a way that also reflects their respective current exposures, as defined in Article 272(17) of the CRR, and does not lead to double-counting of collateral. If the institution chooses a different approach (e.g. a full assignment of collateral to only one synthetic netting set), it should be able to justify this choice and demonstrate that its methodology does not systematically underestimate the resulting exposure values.|184
2676|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 36|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"36. The ECB considers the use of the ""model-estimated collateral balance at $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$""$^{30}$ to be compliant with Article 292(1)(b) of the CRR, if the resulting modelled collateral balance is regularly benchmarked against the actual collateral balance at $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ in accordance with Article 292(1)(g) of the CRR. In this case, validated but still relevant differences between model-estimated and actual $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ collateral balances should be taken into account in the modelling of $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ so that the exposure value is not systematically underestimated. Transactions that are potentially carved out from the IMM as well as collateral potentially not yet settled at $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ should also be taken into account."|203
2677|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 37|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"37. It can be inferred from Article 285(6) in conjunction with Article 285(7) of the CRR that, in order to directly capture the effects of margining in the calculation of exposure values, an institution can use either of the following: 
(a) the option of joint modelling (Article 285(6) of the CRR) for the modelling of all collateral; 
(b) the volatility adjustment option (Article 285(7) of the CRR) for the modelling of all collateral."|129
2678|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 38|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|38. The ECB is of the view that using both options at the same time would only be compliant with the above CRR articles if volatility adjustments for non-cash collateral were used and the joint modelling for the treatment of FX risk were applied in the collateral modelling only. In this context, the ECB considers it best practice that the above combination can only be made by using jointly modelled FX rates for all currencies that are simulated for the exposure calculation under the IMM. In other words, the ECB would not consider a partial application of FX volatility adjustments alongside jointly modelled FX rates for the purpose of collateral modelling as being consistent.|147
2679|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 39|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"39. In the context of Article 285(6) of the CRR, the ECB understands the provision ""an institution shall model collateral … jointly with the exposure in its exposure value calculation"" as requiring model integrity in accordance with Article 292(1)(a) and (b) of the CRR. This means in particular that: 
(a) the collateral value changes over time and during the MPOR are determined by using the same model as for the calculation of the transactions' value changes; 
(b) the use of the same model refers to the IMM's general modelling features (including simulated and non-simulated risk factors, the dependency structure, pricing functions, etc.), which should be used for both the calculation of the transactions' value changes and the calculation of collateral value changes applying the same generated scenarios; 
(c) if some risk factors are not required for the calculation of the transactions' value changes and are only used for the collateral modelling, these risk factors should be modelled consistently with those for derivatives and SFTs within the scope of the IMM, also regarding the dependency structure."|244
2680|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 40|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"40. Article 285(7) of the CRR provides that, if an institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure, it may use volatility adjustments to recognise the effects of margining on the exposure itself, provided the institution complies with the requirements of the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method as per Article 223 of the CRR. If an institution needs to apply volatility adjustments to recognise the effects of margining on the exposure itself, these adjustments must be applied to reflect currency mismatches in accordance with Article 223(1) third sub-paragraph of the CRR. In the light of Article 220(2)(d) of the CRR, the ECB sees the identification of the currency that is potentially different from the collateral currency as described below as best practice: 
(a) when Article 223(1) second sub-paragraph of the CRR uses the term ""the currency in which the underlying exposure of the netting set is denominated"", and when Article 223(1) third sub-paragraph of the CRR (for OTC derivative transactions only) uses the term ""settlement currency"", it is the currency as determined in (b); 
(b) it is the currency: 
(i) agreed in the individual derivative contract if no netting has been agreed upon; or 
(ii) of the relevant governing master netting agreement if agreed without a credit support annex; or 
(iii) of the relevant credit support annex, if agreed; or 
(iv) of the close-out amount if more than one credit support annex has been defined for one master netting agreement."|348
2681|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 41|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"41. The ECB recommends that, in order to comply with Article 292(1)(a) and (b) of the CRR for unmargined cases, and with Article 292(1)(a) and (b) in conjunction with Article 285(6) and (7) for margined cases, institutions take into account the potential FX risk arising from currency mismatches. The potential mismatches are between (i) any of the various currencies of the exposure components (e.g. various transactions with different currencies, collateral types with different currencies) and (ii) the currency in which the netting set's total exposure is determined in the simulation (e.g. the currency of the governing master agreement as explained in paragraph 40). The ECB considers that potential FX risk is treated in compliance with Article 292(1)(a) and (b) of the CRR if either of the following is applied: 
(a) simulation of FX rates for all exposure components at all relevant points in time; 
(b) FX volatility adjustments in accordance with Article 223(1) of the CRR when making use of Article 285(7) of the CRR."|262
2682|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 42|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 4 Collateral modelling > 4.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|42. It is the understanding of the ECB that any potentially remaining FX risk that arises from currency mismatches between (i) the currency in which the netting set's exposure is determined in the simulation and (ii) the reporting currency should be taken into account in the institutions' modelling process. The ECB considers the treatment of this potentially remaining FX risk to be compliant with Article 292(1)(a) and (b) of the CRR if institutions apply the simulated FX rates at the end of the MPOR.$^{31}$|130
2683|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 43|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 5 Modelling of initial margin|43. IM is already applied in central clearing and currently carries over to bilateral OTC agreements. The modelling issue with respect to CCR is that the IM depends on the risk profile of the future netting set in terms of the levels and volatility of simulated market risk factors and on transactions still alive, i.e. it is a variable agreement parameter.|83
2684|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 43|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 5 Modelling of initial margin|"To be clear, it should be specified that ""IM modelling"" refers here to the modelling of IM under the IMM and not, for example, to the implementation of European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) 32 requirements in the institutions' collateral management in terms of calculating an appropriate level of IM."|72
2685|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 44|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 5 Modelling of initial margin > 5.1 Relevant regulatory references|"44. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are the following: 
(a) Article 292(1)(b) of the CRR, which requires institutions to include, among other transaction terms, margining and netting arrangements in the model; Article 292(1)(g) of the CRR, which requires processes for formal reconciliation between the model and source data systems; 
(b) Article 293(1)(b) of the CRR, which notably requires the comparison of risk measures generated by the model with realised risk measures."|139
2686|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 45|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 5 Modelling of initial margin > 5.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|45. In relation to the requirements set out in Article 292(1)(b) of the CRR, and for agreements subject to IM where both the transaction exposures and IM are within the scope of the IMM, the ECB considers it best practice that institutions have an IM modelling that adequately reflects contractual arrangements for the respective netting set. 33 In particular, if contractual arrangements provide that the IM should reflect forward variability and maturing transactions 34 inside netting set value changes relevant for the contractual IM method, the IMM modelling of the IM should take this feature into account unless the institution demonstrates that its choice for IM modelling inside the IMM does not systematically underestimate exposures.|158
2687|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 46|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 5 Modelling of initial margin > 5.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|46. The ECB considers that, in order to avoid the risk of non-compliance with Articles 292(1)(b) and 293(1)(b) of the CRR, the level of the modelled IM at $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ should be benchmarked on a regular basis against the respective real margin at 𝑡$_{0}$ in accordance with Article 292(1)(g) of the CRR. Validated but still relevant differences should be taken into account in the modelling (e.g. by using some corrective exposure level add-on if the modelling is not risk sensitive and/or may lead to non-conservative exposures).|161
2688|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 47|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity|47. This section refers to the estimation of the parameter M used in the calculation of the risk weight for counterparties, towards which the institution has an IMM exposure and for which the institution uses the IRB approach.|53
2689|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 48|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity|48. The section also refers to the treatment of contingent transaction maturities, especially where there are early termination clauses (ETCs, also called break clauses) for derivatives and SFTs, and to different CRR interpretations.|56
2690|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 48|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity|Note that transaction maturities (and their changes) affect (i) the M parameter of Article 162 of the CRR, (ii) the shape of the EE(t) time profile, and (iii) the maximum transaction maturity relevant for Article 284(6) of the CRR, where (i) affects the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) for IRB institutions and (ii) and (iii) affect the calculation of the EEPE and then (via the exposure value) also RWAs.|117
2691|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 49|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity > 6.1 Relevant regulatory references|49. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are the following:|39
2692|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 49|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity > 6.1 Relevant regulatory references|Article 162 (defining the maturity parameter M) and Article 284(4) 35 and (6) (defining the remaining transaction maturity) of the CRR. Contingent transaction maturities and contractual arrangements for early termination are not mentioned in these articles.|74
2693|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 50|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity > 6.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"50. Article 162 of the CRR will be understood as outlined below for the exclusive purpose of applying the IMM as specified by Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 6 of the CRR. In the ECB's understanding, the article should apply in the following way: 
(a) paragraph (2)(b) should apply to unmargined derivatives subject to a master netting agreement if the longest-dated contract in the netting set has a maturity of less than or equal to one year; 
(b) paragraph (2)(c) should apply to fully or nearly fully collateralised derivatives or fully or nearly fully collateralised margin lending transactions subject to a master netting agreement if the longest-dated contract in the netting set has a maturity of less than or equal to one year; 
(c) paragraph (2)(d) should apply to unmargined and margined SFTs (excluding margin lending transactions) subject to a master netting agreement if the longest-dated contract in the netting set has a maturity of less than or equal to one year; 
(d) paragraph (2)(g) should apply to all transactions not subject to a master netting agreement, on the one hand, and to multiple transaction netting sets where the maturity of the transaction or the longest-dated contract within the netting set is greater than one year, on the other hand, unless the conditions for applying paragraph (2)(i) are satisfied; 
(e) if the conditions of paragraph (2)(i) are fulfilled, setting M to one year should apply only for those transactions or netting sets where the application of paragraphs (2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (f) or (g) would result in M being greater than one year; 
(f) the provisions of paragraph (3) regarding the floor value for M should be used in the following way: when applying paragraph (2)(c) or (2)(d) for the purpose of estimating M for a given netting set, an institution should be allowed to use the floor value provided by paragraph (3) (one business day), if all paragraph (3) requirements are fulfilled."|468
2694|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 51|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity > 6.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"51. The CRR is silent on the transaction maturity that should be considered for both the calculation of the EEPE and the calculation of the M parameter in the case of open term repos or, in general, SFTs without an explicitly fixed maturity. 
(a) If the institution has the right to terminate the transaction, in the ECB's view the transaction maturity should be set at the higher of: 
(i) the contractually agreed first date on which the transaction can be terminated; 
(ii) the applicable MPOR. 
(b) If the institution does not have the right to terminate the transaction, the ECB considers that the transaction maturity should be given by the longest past lifetime of transactions with the same or comparable counterparties, subject to a five-year cap."|175
2695|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 52|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity > 6.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"52. For derivatives with ETCs: 
(a) it is seen by the ECB as best practice that non-mandatory ETCs are not used for the calculation of EE as used in Article 284(4) and (6) of the CRR, and of M, as provided for in Article 162(2) of the CRR (this article aims to deal only with a non-contingent maturity), unless the institution can demonstrate that non-mandatory ETCs are regularly exercised based on an assessment of past exercise events. This can be the case: 
(i) generally, i.e. it is possible to calibrate an expected exercise likelihood for non-mandatory ETCs jointly across all paths; or 
(ii) subject to specific, pre-defined market conditions, which allow expected exercise events to be identified along a particular scenario path. 
(b) the ECB also considers it as compliant with Article 162(2) and (3) of the CRR to use mandatory ETCs for the calculation of EE and M instead of the contractual maturity, because there cannot be any positive exposure after that date due to the provisions of Article 284(4) of the CRR. However, the ECB would expect institutions to provide a legal opinion confirming the enforceability of the respective legal clauses. In particular, mandatory ETCs are part of the transaction terms that must be reflected in the model as required by Article 292(1)(a) and (b) of the CRR."|327
2696|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 53|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity > 6.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"53. Internal analyses by the institutions should be able to justify, as the case may be, choices of M values shorter than: 
· five business days for netting sets consisting only of SFTs; 
· ten business days for all other netting sets, including the derivative instruments listed in Annex II of the CRR."|88
2697|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 53|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity > 6.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|In accordance with Article 162(3) of the CRR, provisions for prompt liquidation need to be in place in order to use short M values. If these provisions are different for the M parameter referred to in Article 162 of the CRR than in the IMM exposure modelling of margined trading, the appropriateness of shorter close-out periods would also have to be demonstrated.|98
2698|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 54|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 6 Maturity > 6.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|54. The ECB sees it as best practice when the estimation of the maturity of physically settled options on derivatives (e.g. swaptions, used for the purpose of calculating the parameter M and for the calculation of the EEPE) is made on the basis of the maturity date of the underlying derivatives (e.g. the swap underlying the swaption), unless the institution is able to justify the use of a different maturity for specific products.$^{36}$|112
2699|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 55|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 7 Granularity, number of time steps and scenarios|"55. This section refers to the chosen time grid for the future exposure calculation and the number of scenarios generated. More specifically: 
(a) the number and density of time grid points have an impact on the accuracy of EE profiles and thus also on the accuracy of the EEPE; 
(b) the number of scenarios and the type of random number generator determine the numerical accuracy of the calculations and thus the statistical error of expected exposures."|103
2700|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 56|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 7 Granularity, number of time steps and scenarios > 7.1 Relevant regulatory references|"56. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are the following. 
(a) In accordance with Article 292(1)(a) of the CRR, an institution must ensure that the model reflects transaction terms and specifications in a timely, complete and conservative fashion. Article 292(1)(b) of the CRR specifies that these terms must include at least the contract notional amounts, maturity, reference assets, margining arrangements and netting arrangements. However, it stays silent on the number of grid points necessary to take CFs resulting from these terms into account. 
(b) In accordance with Article 284(4) of the CRR, EE must be calculated for time grid points $_{𝑡}$$_{𝑖}$ = 1, 2, 3, … The output, $_{𝐸𝐸}$ ( 𝑡$_{𝑖}$ ) , is used in the EEPE calculations (Article 284(5) and (6) of the CRR). However, there is no specific requirement as to how to set these $_{𝑡}$$_{𝑖}$values. 
(c) Article 293(1)(c) of the CRR requires an institution to carry out initial and ongoing validation of its CCR exposure model, while Article 294(1) states the requirements that need to be met by the institution's validation programme. While there is no explicit requirement regarding the number of scenarios in Article 294 of the CRR, Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR (which is included in the reference to Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 5 of the CRR made by Article 293(1)(a) of the CRR) requires the internal model to have a proven track record of ""reasonable accuracy"" in measuring risks."|411
2701|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 57|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 7 Granularity, number of time steps and scenarios > 7.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|57. Since the modelling process has to reflect transaction terms, as required by Article 292(1)(a) and (b) of the CRR, in the understanding of the ECB the density and location of grid points as defined in Article 284(4) of the CRR should capture intermediate and final trade-related CFs depending on notional amounts, maturities, etc. that influence the shape of the exposure profile. The ECB also considers that, if the EEPE calculated with a very dense time grid 37 is more than 5% above 38 the EEPE as calculated by the institution using its standard set of grid points under the standard configuration of the IMM for the whole portfolio, then the ECB can increase the alpha parameter following the process described in Section 12. 39 Institutions can conduct this impact assessment on representative sub-portfolios as defined in the Counterparty credit risk glossary.|212
2702|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 58|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 7 Granularity, number of time steps and scenarios > 7.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|58. The ECB considers that the inclusion of the estimation and monitoring of the numerical error of the EEPE due to the number of scenarios in the regular validation programme mentioned in Articles 293(1)(c) and 294(1)(d) of the CRR complies with Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR requirements. If the numerical error$^{40}$ is more than 5% of the EEPE for the whole portfolio, the ECB can increase the alpha parameter following the process described in Section 12. 41 Institutions can conduct this impact assessment on representative sub-portfolios as defined in the Counterparty credit risk glossary.|162
2703|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 59|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 8 Calibration frequency and stress calibration|"59. The calibration frequency is relevant both for regulatory reporting and for internal risk management (line consumption, etc.) as part of the use test requirements set by Article 289 of the CRR: 
(a) for Pillar 1 purposes, Article 292(2) of the CRR requires that the minimum quarterly frequency is increased to reflect (important) changes in market conditions; 
(b) for internal risk management purposes, the calibration frequency also affects the quality of exposure numbers used for the institution's day-today risk management process."|121
2704|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 60|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 8 Calibration frequency and stress calibration|60. To compute own funds requirements for CCR, Article 284(3) of the CRR requires that institutions use two different calibrations: one based on current market data, and one based on a stress period.|59
2705|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 61|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 8 Calibration frequency and stress calibration > 8.1 Relevant regulatory references|"61. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are the following. 
(a) Article 289(1) of the CRR requires among other things ""that the distribution of exposures generated by the model used to calculate EEPE is closely integrated into the day-to-day CCR management process of the institution"", without further specifying the meaning of ""closely integrated"". Article 289(4) of the CRR requires that institutions measure and manage current exposures; Article 289(5) requires them to have system capabilities to estimate EE daily if necessary, unless they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of their competent authorities that their exposures to CCR warrant less frequent calculation. 
(b) In accordance with Article 284(3)(b) of the CRR, institutions must compute the EEPE using a stress calibration. This provision should be read in the light of Article 292(2) of the CRR, which sets out the requirements of the stress calibration, and Article 292(3) of the CRR, which sets out the requirements for the stress period determination. 
(c) In accordance with Article 292(4) of the CRR, the EPE model must use data - implied or historical - that include the data from the stressed credit period and must use such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration of the EPE model to current data. It does not further specify the meaning of ""consistent""."|319
2706|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 62|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 8 Calibration frequency and stress calibration > 8.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|62. The ECB considers that Article 289(1) of the CRR should be understood as implying that the exposure distribution used for internal risk measurement in the day-to-day CCR management process is sufficiently up to date for daily line consumption calculations. Accordingly, the revaluation of current exposure 42 for internal risk management purposes should also be performed on a daily basis in compliance with Article 289(4) and (5) of the CRR. The ECB regards a monthly or higher frequency for the recalibration of the parameters of the underlying stochastic processes (such as drift, volatility and correlation) for internal risk management as best practice to minimise the risk of noncompliance with Article 292(2) and Article 289(5) of the CRR, since an outdated calibration may no longer reflect market conditions or adequately reflect the exposure profile.|195
2707|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 63|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 8 Calibration frequency and stress calibration > 8.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"63. The ECB considers the following to be compliant with Article 292(2) and (4) of the CRR: 
(a) The ECB considers it best practice that parameters underlying the stochastic processes of the EPE model are calibrated with the data from the identified stress period (i.e. with the exact three years of data defining the stress period in the case of historical data) using the same estimation method that is applied for the current calibration. This comprises, in particular, the parameters needed for the simulation of market risk factors, the pricing of transactions and collateral valuation. It is expected that the adequacy of expert-set parameters for the identified stress period is assessed and, if applicable, their values are adjusted accordingly. 
(b) The ECB would accept an alternative stress calibration method for parameters other than volatilities and correlations if the institution is able to demonstrate that its approach is consistent with its current calibration (for example, regarding the length of the calibration window or boundary conditions that need to be satisfied) and does not systematically underestimate exposures."|233
2708|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 64|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test|64. This section refers to implementations of the IMM as used by internal risk management and calculation of the internal line consumption.|34
2709|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 65|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test > 9.1 Relevant regulatory references|"65. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are as follows. 
(a) Article 289 of the CRR includes the following provisions. 
(i) Paragraph (2) of this article requires that institutions demonstrate to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that they have been using a model to calculate the distribution of exposures upon which the EPE calculation is based that broadly meets the requirements set out in Section 6 of the CRR for at least one year prior to permission to use the IMM being granted by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 283 of the CRR. 
(ii) Paragraph (3) of this article requires, among other things, that the model used to generate a distribution of exposures to CCR is part of the CCR management framework required by Article 286 of the CRR. 
(b) Article 286 of the CRR includes the following provisions. 
(i) Paragraph (4) of this article requires, among other things, that an institution's management body and senior management are actively involved in, and ensure that adequate resources are allocated to, the management of CCR. It also requires that senior management is aware of the limitations and assumptions of the model used and the impact those limitations and assumptions can have on the reliability of the output through a formal process. 
(ii) Paragraph (5) of this article requires that the daily reports prepared on an institution's exposures to CCR in accordance with Article 287(2)(b) are reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both reductions in positions taken by individual credit managers or traders and reductions in the institution's overall CCR exposure. 
(iii) Paragraph (6) of this article requires, among other things, that an institution's CCR management framework is used in conjunction with internal credit and trading limits, which need to be related to the institution's risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by credit managers, traders and senior management."|426
2710|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 66|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test > 9.1 Relevant regulatory references|66. Articles 289(2) and 283(2) of the CRR are not explicit as to whether the same use test requirements that need to be applied for model approval should also be applied to model changes and extensions. It is the ECB's understanding that the early implementation of these requirements would provide benefits in terms of model use and supervision, and that their implementation would be consistent with the rationale behind these articles.|103
2711|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 67|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test > 9.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"67. In accordance with the aim of Article 289(2) of the CRR regarding the upfront use of a new model, the ECB considers it best practice for an institution to start by applying the envisaged model changes or extensions for internal risk management purposes to acquire sufficient experience with the change or extension before it is fully implemented. This would apply in cases where the change or extension needs to be investigated as set out in the ECB Guide on materiality assessment (EGMA). 43 The institution should determine the most appropriate upfront use of the model changes or extensions in order to acquire sufficient experience, taking into consideration its situation and the nature of the extension or change. The ECB has identified the following possible ways for an institution to make appropriate upfront use of the model changes and extensions and also to test Pillar 1 own funds requirements: 
(a) implement the extension in the live production environment 44 used to calculate limit utilisation for internal risk management on a daily basis; or 
(b) implement the change or extension in a non-live production environment$^{45}$, where weekly 46 test runs are recommended in the cases (a)-(d) identified in paragraph 68 and during the period between implementation and the sending of the application letter, as well as for the time between the notification of the internal model investigation starting date and the end of the onsite phase of the investigation. Within both periods, the test runs should in general be performed without interruption. It is further recommended that the institution: 
(i) uses the test results to calibrate and document limits that might need an update; 
(ii) identifies and plans the necessary steps for the updated limits to become effective as soon as the supervisory approval envisaged in the EGMA for the planned change or extension is obtained; 
(iii) plans all other processes and controls outlined in Article 289 of the CRR that are to be applied after the permission, in particular ensuring IT performance regarding the calculation frequency."|417
2712|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 67|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test > 9.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|The implementation should be done in such a way that the institution gains sufficient understanding of the intended changes or extensions to its model and its outputs, for instance by providing relevant figures for information purposes in addition to the relevant figures from the model in production for Pillar 1 own fund requirements.|77
2713|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 68|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test > 9.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"68. The practices set out in paragraph 67 above are recommended for all model extensions. In the event of model changes, they are only recommended in the following cases: 
(a) changes in exposure levels (e.g. due to changes in risk factor forecasting, capturing of margining effects or collateral modelling); 
(b) changes of data management/supply (e.g. due to changes of input data or data sources including the use of additional data/data sources or changes of the data quality control processes); 
(c) significant IT system changes (including software changes); 
(d) changes in regular quantitative validation that have a quantitative impact on how the institution assesses the integrity of the IMM."|159
2714|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 68|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test > 9.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"If an extension or a change affecting any of the above items (a) to (d) is classified as ""to be investigated"" by the EGMA, this upfront implementation should be completed within a sufficient time (recommended to be at least three months or two months if more than one test run is carried out per week) before the date of the application letter."|93
2715|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 68|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test > 9.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|Where the institution notifies ex ante an extension or a change affecting any of the above items (a) to (d), the ECB recommends that the institution completes the upfront implementation at least one month before the date of the notification letter if there is a considerable impact on limit utilisation for certain transactions, netting sets or counterparties that are particularly affected by the change or extension owing to its nature.|99
2716|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 68|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test > 9.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|It is noted that institutions may choose different time periods for an upfront implementation, provided that the institution is able to reliably demonstrate that such periods (if shorter) being still significantly ahead of sending the application or notification letter will not limit the validity of the results of the upfront implementation, especially in terms of calibrating limits; if institutions wish to do this, it is recommended that they discuss the matter with the JST.|104
2717|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 68|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 9 Use test > 9.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|Article 286(4) to (6) of the CRR (to which Article 289(3) refers) requires in general that the institution's management and senior management are actively involved in the management of the CCR model. The ECB considers that as well as being involved in the upfront use of a changed or extended model, the management and senior management should also be involved in approving any limit change resulting from the prior implementation of an IMM model change or extension in the live production environment as envisaged in paragraph 67(a) above, or any limit change or extension expected to result from the tests in the non-live production environment as envisaged in paragraph 67(b) above.|159
2718|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 69|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation|69. This section refers to the validation framework set up by institutions to assess the performance of the CCR exposure model, in particular back-testing methodologies, the validation of pricing functions and further checks on key modelling assumptions.|52
2719|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 70|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.1 Relevant regulatory references|"70. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are as follows. 
(a) Article 287(2) of the CRR states that the risk control unit is expected to be responsible for the initial and ongoing validation of the model. Furthermore, Article 293(1)(c) of the CRR provides that the validation and review must be conducted independently of model development, which needs to be reconciled with Article 287(2) of the CRR given that model development is usually also done within the risk control unit. 
(b) Article 293(4) of the CRR requires, among other things, that institutions ""maintain a written policy that describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be identified and remedied"", without further describing what constitutes unacceptable performance and what the remedies might be. 
(c) According to Article 292(6)(a) of the CRR, ""an institution shall subject the model to a validation process that specifies the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which the assumptions underlying the model are inappropriate and therefore result in an understatement of EPE"". However, the CRR does not further specify which assumptions should form part of the validation process. 
(d) Article 293(1)(b) of the CRR requires institutions to conduct ""a regular programme of back-testing"" but does not further specify the frequency of the back-testing. 
(e) Regarding the requirements laid out with respect to back-testing levels$^{47}$ and methodologies, Article 294(1)(c) of the CRR provides that ""an institution shall back-test the performance of its CCR exposure model and the model's relevant risk measures as well as market risk factor predictions"", without mentioning any restrictions. Article 294(1)(h) of the CRR requires the model validation process to ""include static, historical back-testing on representative counterparty portfolios that are actual or hypothetical"", not specifying whether the ""or"" in this sentence is an inclusive or exclusive ""or"". According to Article 294(1)(i) and (j) of the CRR, ""back-testing shall be designed to test the relevant risk measures"" and furthermore ""be appropriate and capable of identifying poor performance in an EPE model's risk measure"". 
(f) Article 294(1)(g) of the CRR states that ""as part of the initial and ongoing validation of its CCR exposure model and its risk measures, an institution shall ensure that the CCR exposure model includes transaction-specific information to capture the effects of margining"", without specifying any further details of the expected validation tasks. 
(g) Article 292(1)(a) of the CRR requires that the model reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, complete and conservative fashion (also regarding pricing and the market data to be used). Article 292(1)(b) of the CRR specifies that those terms include, at least, notional amounts, maturity, reference assets, margining arrangements and netting arrangements. Article 292(1)(g) of the CRR requires ongoing processes for reconciliation between the model and source data, which verify that transaction terms and specifications are reflected correctly or at least conservatively. 
(h) Article 294(1)(e) of the CRR provides that, as part of the initial and ongoing validation process, an institution ""shall test the pricing models used to calculate CCR exposure for a given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors"", as well as regularly testing these pricing models against appropriate independent benchmarks in accordance with Article 294(1)(l) of the CRR. 
(i) As outlined in Article 294(1)(o) of the CRR, ""the initial and ongoing validation of CCR exposure models shall assess whether or not the counterparty level and netting set exposure calculations of exposure are appropriate"". Article 294(1)(d) of the CRR provides that ""if the model validation indicates that EEPE is underestimated, the institution shall take the action necessary to address the inaccuracy of the model"". Both requirements are set out in a general way and therefore need further guidance. 
(j) Article 292(1)(a) of the CRR requires the model to reflect transaction terms which must be ensured by formal reconciliation processes between the model and source data in accordance with point (g) of the same article."|912
2720|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 71|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"71. In accordance with Article 293(1)(c) of the CRR, model validation/review and model development must be conducted independently, that is, the validation function as defined in the glossary must be effectively separated from model development. Hence, the ECB considers that for cases where certain parts of the validation framework, e.g. back-testing or the benchmarking of IMM pricing functions, are conducted by staff also responsible for model design and development, the above-mentioned requirement could still be observed with the implementation of the following practices: 
(a) a regular, independent and effective challenging of the underlying methodological aspects of the respective validation task comprising at least scope, data samples, tools/statistical tests (including, if applicable, test statistics and thresholds 48 in use) is performed by the validation function; 
(b) the assessment of the outcomes of the analysis (e.g. the evaluation of back-testing traffic lights or pricing deficiencies detected in the benchmarking) and the judgement regarding the respective remediation measures are reviewed by the validation function, which may require further analyses and/or changes to the actions concerned."|244
2721|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 71|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|Moreover, the ECB considers that the organisational requirements of the risk control unit (see Article 287(2) of the CRR) should be regarded as fulfilled when (part of) the initial or ongoing validation of the model is conducted by staff not belonging directly to the risk control unit, but for instance to a separate validation unit.$^{49}$|90
2722|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 71|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|As part of the process by which unacceptable performance will be identified and remedied in accordance with Article 293(4) of the CRR, the ECB considers it best practice that a comprehensive view of all the findings, problems, weaknesses and limits of the exposure model, identified by all staff contributing to the validation and review of the exposure model, is ensured.|91
2723|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 72|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"72. The validation framework is expected to cover the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity and the appropriateness of assumptions underlying the model in accordance with Article 292(6)(a) of the CRR. The ECB considers it best practice to include various types of analyses on the key modelling assumptions in a regular validation schedule. In particular, it is the ECB's understanding that the key modelling assumptions contain: 
(a) the grid point setting; 
(b) the chosen stochastic processes$^{50}$; 
(c) the Monte Carlo error of the EEPE (see paragraph 58); 
(d) expert-set parameters and boundaries in use (such as caps and floors for risk factor paths); 
(e) all pricing functions used in the IMM; 
(f) modelling features regarding margining, i.e. the MPOR setting, agreementdependent variation margin and IM mechanisms and the modelling of collateral value changes during the MPOR."|208
2724|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 73|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|73. In order to comply with Article 293(1)(b) of the CRR, the ECB sees it as best practice if back-testing is performed and reported on at least once a year.|61
2725|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 74|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|74. In accordance with Article 294(1)(c) of the CRR, back-testing at risk factor level is mandatory. In the ECB's view, not all key assumptions of the CCR exposure model (mentioned in Article 294(1)(i) of the CRR) can be captured when backtesting is only conducted on hypothetical portfolios, in particular when considering non-plain vanilla transactions or margined netting sets. Hence, in the light of Article 294(1)(h) of the CRR, the ECB regards back-testing at both actual and hypothetical portfolio level as best practice.|143
2726|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 75|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|75. In order to support the analysis of portfolio back-testing and mitigate the risk of breaching Article 294(1)(e) and (i) of the CRR, it is recommended and seen as best practice to include back-testing at single transaction level in the regular framework.|77
2727|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 76|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"76. According to Article 294(1)(h) of the CRR, back-testing samples 51 must be representative and chosen on the basis of their sensitivity to material risk factors as well as their combinations. As stated in point (j) of the same paragraph in Article 294, the institution's back-testing programme must be capable of identifying poor performance of an EPE model's risk measures. As a result, the ECB considers that back-testing samples should allow for a meaningful assessment of the CCR exposure model and that institutions should ensure a comprehensive coverage of their back-testing framework by calculating back-testing coverage ratios (i.e. shares of back-tested risk factors or portfolios), at least at risk factor and, if applicable, at actual portfolio level. In particular: 
(a) next to a simple number-based 52 approach, institutions should take into account different weighting schemes like sensitivities and exposure metrics; 
(b) at risk factor level, in addition to the full risk factor set$^{53}$, coverage ratios should also be calculated by asset class;$^{54}$ 
(c) institutions should be able to provide an explanation justifying the level of the respective coverage ratio."|257
2728|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 76|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|Such coverage ratios should form part of the back-testing reports to ensure that the scope of the back-testing is transparent.|42
2729|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 76|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|Furthermore, it is the ECB's understanding that, if SFTs are within the IMM scope, their inclusion in the back-testing samples is compliant with the representativeness requirements stated in Article 294(1)(h) of the CRR.|69
2730|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 77|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|77. The ECB considers that statistical tests used for back-testing should be adapted when back-testing samples contain forecasts over fully or partially overlapping time periods 55 (compared with standard versions of statistical tools applicable for the case of non-overlapping forecasts) to account for dependencies in the sample and therefore serve as a proper indicator of the model performance. In the view of the ECB, this practice would avoid the risk of being in breach of Article 294(1)(j) of the CRR.|119
2731|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 78|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|78. Where back-testing relies only on IMM pricing functions for both predictions and realisations (i.e. realised prices derived from benchmarking systems are not taken into account), the attention given to the assessment of the adequacy of IMM pricing functions (as provided for by Article 294(1)(e) and (l) of the CRR) is seen to be even more important. Consequently, in the view of the ECB, institutions should strengthen their validation/review of IMM pricing functions accordingly.|120
2732|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 79|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|79. In order to ensure appropriate back-testing practices as required by Article 294(1)(j) of the CRR, the ECB sees it as best practice to pay special attention to the consistency of predictions and realisations in the case of actual portfolio back-testing; in other words, changes of the portfolio composition during the observation period (e.g. due to new or closed-out transactions) should be handled accordingly.|104
2733|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 80|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"80. In accordance with Article 294(1)(c), (e) and (g) of the CRR as understood by the ECB in paragraphs 74 and 75 of this chapter, the ECB sees benefit in back- testing different relevant risk measures, including the market value 56 at transaction level, the market value of netting sets 57 as well as the exposure 58 at netting set level. 
(a) Market value corrections resulting from the application of paragraph 14 of this chapter are considered to be part of the IMM and should hence be reflected in the back-testing framework. Therefore, such corrections should be taken into account when performing back-testing both on the level of predictions and on the level of realisations, if the latter are calculated using the IMM pricing functions. Regarding predictions, the ECB considers it best practice for an institution to complement this approach with an additional back-testing run that does not take into account the market value corrections in the predictions. Regarding realisations, either the market value with correction or the market value coming directly from a benchmarking system can be used. In cases where the comparison of these back-testing runs shows significantly different results, the institution should investigate the root cause of these differences to support the validation of the market value corrections. 
(b) If direct back-testing of the exposure of margined netting sets is not feasible, institutions should have a separate validation of the margining process, of collateral value changes and of netting set market value changes over the relevant time horizons."|326
2734|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 81|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"81. In order to reduce the risk of breaching Article 292(1)(a) and (g) of the CRR and based on the requirements of Article 294(1)(l) of the CRR, institutions should compare the values of pricing functions used for revaluation under the IMM with values from a benchmarking system on a regular basis. 
(a) The ECB understands Article 294(1)(o) of the CRR as requiring a validation of the identification process for significant price differences (see paragraph 12) as well as a corresponding full analysis of these differences and their root causes. 
(b) The action taken to address the inaccuracy of the model in accordance with Article 294(1)(d) of the CRR, including price corrections also for future grid points in accordance with paragraph 14, should be validated.$^{59}$"|196

(a) The model-estimated collateral balance at $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$ is benchmarked against the actual collateral balance at $_{𝑡}$$_{0}$, if applicable (see paragraph 36). 
(b) Institutions benchmark the IM (see paragraph 46)."|113
2736|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 82|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|A full analysis of the differences detected, their root causes and the action taken to address the inaccuracy of the model should be conducted regularly in order to reduce the risk of breaching Article 294(1)(d) and (o) of the CRR.|72
2737|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 83|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"83. For the purposes of Article 294(1)(e), (l) and (o) of the CRR, in accordance with the understanding of the ECB described in paragraph 17 and in addition to paragraph 81, the ECB considers it best practice that institutions assess the following within their validation framework. 
(a) Whether deviations from a full simulation 60 are documented and justified. 
(b) Whether the effect of using approximated pricing functions instead of those from any reliable benchmarking system is not significant. 
(c) Whether, for all approximated pricing functions, the value changes due to risk factor changes occurring in IMM simulated paths are reliable compared with value changes from non-approximated pricing functions (from any reliable benchmarking system) for the same transaction type. 
(d) If any alternative way to calculate exposures is used, the ECB considers that the items mentioned in paragraph 17(b) of this chapter should also be met. Furthermore, validation should ensure that the respective methods are applied in a way that does not lead to a systematic underestimation of exposures compared with the full simulation (as described in paragraph 5) for the transactions affected."|254
2738|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 83|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|In the ECB's understanding, transactions treated with alternative exposure calculation methods should also be included in the back-testing framework. In order to fulfil the requirements of Article 294(1)(o) of the CRR, the ECB sees it as beneficial to also analyse affected transactions separately rather than mixing effects when back-testing is only conducted at actual portfolio level.|89
2739|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 83|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 10 Validation > 10.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|"In addition, the netting benefits (numerical impact) when using any type of alternative method to calculate exposures in the IMM should be assessed by comparing the resulting exposure with those obtained after: 
(i) splitting the transactions into synthetic netting sets differentiating between transactions treated using the ""standard"" IMM calculation and those where exposures are calculated in an alternative way; 
(ii) carving-out the affected transactions into a standardised method."|105

2742|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 86|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 11 Effective expected positive exposure > 11.1 Relevant regulatory references|86. The corrigendum of 25 January 2017 amends the formula in Article 284(6) of the CRR by dividing the weighted sum of the Effective EEs by the applicable time horizon (1 year or the maturity of the longest-dated transaction belonging to a netting set if this is below 1 year):|89
2743|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 86|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 11 Effective expected positive exposure > 11.1 Relevant regulatory references|However, the units of the weights $_{∆𝑡}$$_{𝑘}$ and $_{𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦}$ still need to be defined.|74
2744|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 87|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 11 Effective expected positive exposure > 11.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision|87. In the understanding of the ECB, Article 284(6) of the CRR should be understood as requiring that the weights $_{∆𝑡}$$_{𝑘}$ and the parameter $_{𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦}$ are expressed in units of one year.|102
2745|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 88|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 12 Alpha parameter|88. The alpha multiplier affects all netting sets and thus all counterparties and should be considered as intending to capture extra risk arising, for example, from the fact that exposures are correlated with credit drivers (e.g. PD, LGD) and to address general deficiencies in the IMM framework. Alpha is the only parameter besides capital buffers that can be increased explicitly to account for such deficiencies.|88
2746|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 89|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 12 Alpha parameter > 12.1 Relevant regulatory references|"89. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are the following: 
(a) Article 284(4) of the CRR defines the exposure value as the product of alpha and the EEPE with ""α = 1.4, unless competent authorities require a higher α or permit institutions to use their own estimates in accordance with paragraph 9 [of Article 284 of the CRR]""; 
(b) Article 293(2) of the CRR, based on Article 284(4) of the CRR, links the level 62 of the supervisory alpha setting to the degree with which the institution meets the requirements for the risk management system as set out in Article 293(1) of the CRR; 
(c) Article 293(1) of the CRR refers in particular to overall validation, adequate processes, integration into the day-to-day risk management process and limit utilisation (use test), documentation and independent reviews."|219
2747|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 90|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 12 Alpha parameter > 12.2 Supervisory actions|90. In accordance with Article 284(4) of the CRR, the ECB can increase the alpha parameter in a proportionate and appropriate way for either an interim or an undefined period to address model, risk management or governance deficiencies identified by the ECB. In particular, targeted deficiencies may include (i) model deficiencies, which lead or may lead to an underestimation of the EEPE as defined in Article 284(5) and (6) of the CRR and Article 285 of the CRR for margined trading, or (ii) deficiencies in the validation framework.|137
2748|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 90|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 12 Alpha parameter > 12.2 Supervisory actions|"It should be noted that: 
(a) both supervisory alpha increases related to an interim period and those related to an undefined period require explicit supervisory decisions; 
(b) if alpha is increased for an interim period, the decision will specify the length of the interim period or the condition when it ends."|78
2749|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 91|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 12 Alpha parameter > 12.2 Supervisory actions|"91. The ECB can base the amount of a potential alpha increase above the floor values to the extent possible on an available impact analysis. 
(a) The analysis assesses 63 the impact on the EEPE as calculated without the identified model deficiency. 
(b) As this deficiency is obviously related to the standard configuration of the IMM, which contains this deficiency, an impact calculation based only on a subset of the relevant portfolio could be accepted for this purpose. This calculation can be performed in a well-defined developer area for representative sub-portfolios (as defined in the Counterparty credit risk glossary). 
(c) Some non-exhaustive examples of how identified model deficiencies can increase alpha are discussed in this document (see for example paragraphs 21, 57 and 58), where the general alpha increase (applied to all netting sets) reflects whether the identified deficiencies possibly affect only a part of the netting sets (e.g. only the margined ones). 
(d) The ECB considers that increases should be in multiples of half a decimal point. For example, if alpha = 1.4, alpha becomes at least 1.45 if an increase is deemed necessary."|256
2750|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 91|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 12 Alpha parameter > 12.2 Supervisory actions|If no impact calculations are available, the ECB may estimate the amount of the alpha increase in a conservative way using all other available information.|44
2751|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 92|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 13 Risks not in effective expected positive exposure|92. Depending on the set-up of the IMM and the nature of the transactions, some quantifiable risks may not be captured, or may not be adequately captured, by the IMM. This section refers to processes for identifying, monitoring and capitalising such risks.|68
2752|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 93|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 13 Risks not in effective expected positive exposure > 13.1 Relevant regulatory references|"93. The regulatory provisions relating to the topic addressed in this section that require further guidance are the following. 
(a) Article 92(3)(f) of the CRR specifies the types of transactions and agreements to be included in the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amounts for the CCR. 
(b) Article 430(1) of the CRR in conjunction with Article 5(1) of the Commission Implementing Regulation on supervisory reporting requires institutions to report the information relating to own funds requirements with a quarterly frequency. 
(c) Article 284(1)(a) of the CRR requires that the model used by the institution specify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to joint changes in relevant market variables such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. 
(d) Article 284(3) of the CRR requires the own funds requirement for CCR exposures under the IMM to be the higher of (a) the own funds requirement for those exposures calculated on the basis of EEPE using current market data, and (b) the own funds requirement for those exposures calculated on the basis of EEPE using a single consistent stress calibration for all CCR exposures to which the IMM is applied. 
(e) Article 284(4) to (6) of the CRR describes the way the exposure value is calculated based on EEPE. 
(f) Article 284(8) of the CRR allows institutions to use a measure of the distribution calculated by the IMM that is more conservative than  multiplied by EEPE as calculated in accordance with the equation in Article 284(4) for every counterparty. 
(g) In accordance with Article 287(2) of the CRR, the independent risk control unit is responsible for the design and implementation of its CCR management, including the initial and ongoing validation of the model. Specifically, under Article 287(2)(c) of the same regulation, the independent risk control must control input data integrity and produce and analyse reports on the output of the institution's risk measurement model, including an evaluation of the relationship between measures of risk exposure and credit and trading limits. 
(h) In accordance with Article 288 of the CRR, an independent review of the CCR management system should be conducted regularly through an internal auditing process encompassing both the activities of the control and collateral management units as required by Article 287 of the CRR. 
(i) Article 290 of the CRR describes the requirements for the stress testing programme. Specifically, Article 290(9) of the same regulation requires the results of the stress testing to be regularly reported to senior management, at least on a quarterly basis. The reports and analysis of the results must cover the largest counterparty-level impacts across the portfolio, material concentrations within segments of the portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends. 
(j) In accordance with Article 292(1)(a) and (b) of the CRR, institutions must ensure the integrity of the modelling process by adopting at least the following measures: (a) the model must reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, complete and conservative fashion; (b) those terms must include at least contract notional amounts, maturity, reference assets, margining arrangements and netting arrangements. 
(k) In accordance with Article 292(1)(g) of the CRR, institutions must ensure the integrity of the modelling process by adopting a certain number of measures including processes for formal reconciliation between the model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least conservatively. 
(l) Article 292(2) to (5) of the CRR describes requirements for the calibration of the IMM using current and stressed market data. 
(m) In accordance with Article 292(6) of the CRR, institutions must subject the model to a validation process that is clearly formulated in their policies and procedures. 
(n) In accordance with Article 292(7) of the CRR, institutions must monitor relevant risks such as their exposures to specific wrong-way risk and general wrong-way risk, their exposures with a rising risk profile after one year and their exposures with a residual maturity below one year. 
(o) In accordance with Article 293(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must meet the qualitative requirements set out in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 5 of the"|940

(p) In accordance with Article 293(1)(b) and (c) of the CRR, institutions must conduct a regular programme of back-testing and carry out an initial validation and ongoing periodic reviews of their CCR exposure models and the risk measures generated by them. 
(q) In accordance with Article 294(1)(d) of the CRR, if the model validation indicates that EEPE is underestimated, institutions must take the action necessary to address the inaccuracy of the model. 
(r) Article 294(1)(g) of the CRR requires institutions to validate that the CCR exposure model includes transaction-specific information to capture the effects of margining and that it accounts for the nature of margin agreements. 
(s) Article 294(1)(k) of the CRR requires institutions to validate their CCR exposure models and all risk measures out to time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades. 
(t) Article 294(1)(m) of the CRR requires that the validation of an institution's CCR exposure model and its relevant risk measures include an assessment of the adequacy of the recent performance. 
(u) Article 294(1)(n) of the CRR requires institutions to assess the frequency with which the parameters of an CCR exposure model are updated as part of the initial and ongoing validation process. 
(v) Article 294(1)(o) of the CRR requires that the initial and ongoing validation of CCR exposure models assess whether or not the counterparty level and netting set exposure calculations of exposure are appropriate. 
(w) In accordance with Article 287(2)(d) and (f) of the CRR, institutions must have a risk control unit that is independent from units responsible for originating, renewing or trading exposures and that reports directly to senior management. The unit must conduct the initial and ongoing validation, being responsible for designing and implementing the CCR management system. 
(x) In accordance with Article 293(1)(a) of the CRR referring to Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 5 and more particularly to Article 368(1)(b) of the CRR, institutions must have a risk control unit that is independent from business trading units and reports directly to senior management, being responsible for designing and implementing any internal model. The unit must conduct the initial and ongoing validation, being responsible for the overall risk management system. 
(y) In accordance with Article 368(1)(e) of the CRR, institutions must have in place established procedures for monitoring and ensuring compliance with a documented set of internal policies and controls concerning the overall operation of its internal models. 
(z) In accordance with Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR, any internal must have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risks. 
(aa) In accordance with Article 368(1)(h) of the CRR, institutions must conduct an independent review of their internal models as part of their regular internal auditing process. 
(bb) In accordance with Article 368(2)(d) of the CRR, the review mentioned in Article 368(1)(h) of the CRR must be conducted at least once a year and must consider various elements, including the scope of risks captured by the risk measurement model."|724

(a) initial and ongoing internal validation of the IMM, as referred to in Articles 287(2), 292(6), 293(1)(b) and (c), and 294 of the CRR; 
(b) back-testing as referred to in Article 294 of the CRR; 
(c) controls of input data integrity as referred to in Article 287(2)(c) of the CRR; 
(d) with regard to the approval of new products, analysing whether the characteristics inherent in the new products can be adequately captured by the IMM in order to ensure that these new products are fully compatible with the comprehensive risk control and validation by the risk control unit, as required by Article 368(1)(b) of the CRR; 
(e) stress testing as referred to in Article 290 of the CRR."|244
2773|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 104|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 13 Risks not in effective expected positive exposure > 13.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision > 13.2.2 Identification|In accordance with Article 368(2)(d) of the CRR, the annual review of an institution's overall risk management process must consider the scope of risks captured by the risk measurement model. Therefore, the ECB considers that a review and, if necessary, an update of the RNIEPE inventory should be carried out at least once a year.|105
2774|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 105|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 13 Risks not in effective expected positive exposure > 13.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision > 13.2.3 Quantifications|105. As identified RNIEPE are considered to be part of the IMM, the quantification of each RNIEPE should (to the extent possible) be methodologically similar to the respective exposure quantification in the IMM, reflecting either an expected exposure averaged over one year or an increment to an EEPE, taking relevant stress calibrations (as set out in Articles 284(3)(b) and 292(2) to (5) of the CRR) into account where applicable. This would imply that two quantifications are not necessary in cases where the expected RNIEPE exposures (EREs) according to the current calibration and the stress calibration are very similar.|173

2778|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 106|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 13 Risks not in effective expected positive exposure > 13.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision > 13.2.3 Quantifications|"106. The value of the risk weight referred to in paragraph 105 above may depend on how many counterparties are affected by a given RNIEPE. 
(a) If the ERE related to a given RNIEPE can be calculated per netting set, the risk weight(s) 73 applied should be the same as that taken for the exposure value for the respective netting set as referred to in Article 284(4) of the CRR, regardless of whether a standardised risk weight or an IRB approach is applied for the calculation of own funds requirements according to Article 92(3)(f) of the CRR. Thus, the risk exposure amount should be calculated as where $_{𝑅𝑊}$$_{𝑛}$ denotes the risk weight corresponding to the n-th netting set affected by RNIEPE, and $_{𝐸𝑅𝐸}$$_{𝑛}$ the corresponding expected RNIEPE exposure. 
(b) Alternatively, if the ERE is calculated simultaneously across several netting sets (i.e. no calculation of a single $_{𝐸𝑅𝐸}$$_{𝑛}$$_{ }$is possible), it is recommended that institutions follow one of the following two approaches: 
(i) apply one risk weight to all affected counterparties or nettings sets being as high as the highest risk weight of the set of affected counterparties or netting sets: where $_{𝑅𝑊}$ = max 𝑛 { 𝑅𝑊 $_{𝑛}$ for affected counterparties 𝑛 = 1, … , 𝑁 } ; 
(ii) apply an average risk weight to all affected counterparties or netting sets, which takes the relative materiality of exposures into account and does not systematically underestimate risk weights, provided the methodology of averaging is justified and internally validated."|430

In accordance with Article 368(1)(e) and (f) of the CRR, the ECB considers it best practice that institutions quantify RNIEPE in an appropriate way and document and duly justify the methodology applied, in order to assess the need to incorporate the RNIEPE into EEPE.|99
2780|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 107|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 13 Risks not in effective expected positive exposure > 13.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision > 13.2.3 Quantifications|Because the quantification of the impact should allow the different RNIEPE to be assessed individually, no diversification effect should be applied between different RNIEPE when quantifying an individual RNIEPE.|75
2781|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 108|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 13 Risks not in effective expected positive exposure > 13.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision > 13.2.3 Quantifications|"108. The ECB considers it best practice that for each RNIEPE identified, the quantification of the ERE is estimated based on the resulting (incremental$^{74}$) exposure when the RNIEPE is incorporated into EEPE as follows. 
(a) The baseline is the EEPE based on the same transactions and netting sets as used in production (without any RNIEPE add-ons). 
(b) Where the RNIEPE does not depend on the stress calibration and is incorporated into one EEPE according to (a) above, either the difference between that EEPE and the current EEPE, or the difference between that EEPE and the stressed EEPE, whichever is higher, should be used. Alternatively, two incremental measures can be calculated, one stressed, one current, in line with paragraph 105 of this chapter, and the higher of the two should be taken into account. 
(c) The incremental exposure can be any positive or negative number. The calculation of the incremental exposure may result in a negative number if the incorporation of the RNIEPE has a risk-reducing effect. In that case, and in line with paragraph 105, the incremental exposure is set to zero for the respective netting set. 
(d) The quantification of the impact should be as accurate as possible using reasonable effort. Therefore, the ECB understands that the impact estimation methodology can use appropriate approximations, assumptions, expert judgement or a stress methodology. Any such approximations, assumptions or expert judgement should be duly justified and documented."|346
2782|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 109|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 13 Risks not in effective expected positive exposure > 13.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision > 13.2.3 Quantifications|"109. The ECB considers that a prudent impact quantification differing from that described in paragraph 108 above could be used where this is duly justified. Where using an RNIEPE is justified but an appropriate impact quantification using an incremental exposure cannot be performed for this RNIEPE, the ECB considers it a prudent approach to perform an estimation of the impact of a RNIEPE based on an exposure calculation outside the EEPE where the RNIEPE is the only source of risks. 
(a) For this stand-alone impact estimation of ERE, the institution should demonstrate that it does not systematically underestimate the incremental exposure or that the calculation of the incremental exposure is misleading. 
(b) Where trade-related cash flows may be missing from the EEPE calculation as discussed in the case of margined trading in paragraph 20 of this chapter, the ECB expects the following method to be applied to account for such cash flows when calculating ERE in the RNIEPE add-on: 
(i) The ERE for one netting set is given by the formula: 
(ii) The term $_{𝐸𝑆𝐸}$$_{𝑡}$$_{𝑘}$, the expected spike exposure, is calculated as the expected exposure increase due to trade-related cash flow payments from the institution to the defaulting counterparty during the MPOR between time grid points $_{𝑡}$$_{𝑘}$ and $_{𝑡}$$_{𝑘-1}$ attached to the time grid point"|345

The ECB considers that in order to ensure that the quantification of RNIEPE is appropriately accurate in accordance with Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR, the quantification should, where possible, make use of objective market data. Where the quality of the data used is insufficient, the institution should be aware of the effect this might have on the quantification of the respective RNIEPE and, if necessary, take measures to mitigate the effect. This should also be part of the documentation of the respective RNIEPE.|146

In order to ensure alignment with the EEPE, when quantifying an RNIEPE the calibration methodology for the ERE should be based on the same methodology as used for the EEPE. For example, it should be based on the same observation period if the EEPE is based on historical calibration. Any differences should be duly justified. If scarce data are used for calibration, they should be used in a way that avoids a systematic underestimation of exposure. This may involve relying to some extent on expert judgement, which should be well documented and explained.|149

As mentioned previously, the identification, quantification and management of the RNIEPE should be integrated into the CCR management framework. The ECB therefore considers that in order to ensure that ongoing risk measurement is accurate according to Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR, the risk control unit should carry out regular impact quantification and monitoring of all RNIEPE. The outcome should be reported to the relevant stakeholders in line with the processes set out in the institution's RNIEPE framework.|141

In accordance with Article 430 of the CRR in conjunction with Article 5(1) of the Commission Implementing Regulation on supervisory reporting, institutions must submit the information relating to own funds requirements with a quarterly frequency. Therefore, the ECB considers that in order to assess the adequacy of own funds, institutions should quantify and monitor the RNIEPE add-ons and adjust their scope at least quarterly.|122
2791|ECB Guide to internal models, 2024|Paragraph 114|Other|Counterparty credit risk > 13 Risks not in effective expected positive exposure > 13.2 Principles for ECB Banking Supervision > 13.2.4 Management of RNIEPE|"114. More particularly, regarding the requirement under Article 368(1)(f) of the CRR that internal models should have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risk, the ECB considers it a good practice for institutions to determine thresholds for treating individual and combined RNIEPE as part of their RNIEPE management. Such thresholds are based on the ratio of the ERE as defined in paragraph 105 of this chapter over the EEPE, in which regard no RNIEPE are to be included in the denominators of the following ratios. 
(a) For a single $_{𝐸𝑅𝐸}$$_{𝑖}$ of type $_{𝑖}$ as described in paragraphs 108 and 109 of this chapter relating to one netting set, the ratio used for determining whether an RNIEPE is substantial is calculated as follows: 
(b) If one $_{𝐸𝑅𝐸}$$_{𝑖}$ relates, for example, to a non-modelled risk factor in the IMM that affects a number of netting sets or counterparties (overall $_{𝑁}$ netting sets), the ratio used for determining whether an RNIEPE is substantial is calculated as follows: 
(c) Regarding all $_{𝐸𝑅𝐸}$$_{𝑖}$, except the ERE on exposure spikes, the ratio used to determine if RNIEPE should be included in EEPE for overall $_{𝑁}$ netting sets affected by RNIEPE type $_{𝑖}$ and $_{𝑀}$ netting sets in the overall IMM scope should be: where $_{𝐼}$ denotes the overall number of RNIEPE types different from the RNIEPE related to spikes. 
(d) For the ERE associated with exposures spikes in a netting set $_{𝑛}$ as described in paragraph 109(b) above, the ratio used to determine whether this RNIEPE should be included in EEPE is given (using the notation of the above point (c)) by:"|473

Regarding RNIEPE that are identified as not being substantial according to one of the processes described in paragraph 104 of this chapter, the ECB recommends that institutions either define quantitative thresholds using the above or similar metrics or define qualitative methodological criteria to identify RNIEPE that are not substantial but require at least the monitoring described in paragraph 100 of this chapter.|112

The thresholds on the ratios (a) to (d) described in paragraph 114 above should include at least: 
(a) a threshold on the ratios (a) and (b) above which individual RNIEPE are considered as substantial and capitalised with RNIEPE add-ons as recommended in paragraph 105; 
(b) a (higher) threshold on ratios (a) and (b) above which individual RNIEPE are to be included in the EEPE calculation in accordance with Article 284(64) of the CRR, in which regard additional qualitative criteria possibly defined by the institution could also lead to an inclusion in EEPE, even if the quantitative threshold is not breached; 
(c) a threshold on ratio (c) above which one or more RNIEPE are to be included in the EEPE calculation in accordance with Article 284(64) of the CRR so that the sum of the remaining RNIEPE leads to a ratio (c) below this threshold$^{75}$;

Therefore, and in the absence of RTS for CCR, the ECB considers, by analogy and also using this threshold for the IMM, that if the cumulative RNIEPE impact corresponds to more than 10% of the amount computed using EEPE, this indicates that the EEPE might not capture accurately all material risks.|248

The ECB considers it a prudent approach that RNIEPE that are to be incorporated into the EEPE in accordance with paragraphs 118 and 119 are capitalised with RNIEPE add-ons - if this is not already the case - as part of the implementation plan, until they are incorporated into EEPE.

Because the RNIEPE framework is an integral part of the overall IMM processes, a change to the RNIEPE framework - and in particular a change relating to the RNIEPE identification methodology, the impact quantification methodology or the RNIEPE add-on methodology - should be considered as an IMM model change. The ECB considers that the EGMA could provide appropriate guidance on assessing these changes.$^{76}$ 
(a) The ECB considers that changes to the RNIEPE framework should in general be notified ex ante to the ECB.

In the view of the ECB, ceasing to capitalise an RNIEPE because ratios under paragraph 114(a) and (b) of this chapter are below the thresholds set out in paragraph 117, or starting to capitalise an RNIEPE with an RNIEPE add-on according to the thresholds of the RNIEPE framework, would not constitute a model change and does not need to be separately notified as a model change, provided that it is based on the approved methodology of the RNIEPE framework.|145

The incorporation of an individual RNIEPE into EEPE, irrespective of whether it was previously treated as an RNIEPE add-on, and irrespective of whether it is a previously identified or newly identified RNIEPE, constitutes an IMM model change and should therefore be assessed using the EGMA. 
(a) If a change or extension of the RNIEPE framework or the incorporation of an individual RNIEPE into the EEPE receives the classification ""ex ante"" but is very close to the classification ""to be investigated"", the individual RNIEPE or those RNIEPE that contribute to that materiality should be integrated into the EEPE.
