    "# Extracting requirements from the ECB Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is designed to process the JSON output of an SCE Guide converted using Docling and transform  \n",
    "the structured requirements into a pandas DataFrame. The primary goal is to extract headings at different   \n",
    "levels (Level 0 to Level 3) into separate columns and organize the associated text into single rows.   \n",
    "Additionally, the script extracts paragraph numbers from the text for better indexing and fills missing  \n",
    "numbers where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that this approach provides a starting point, which needs to be reviewed manually**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps in the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. **Extract Headings and Text**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `extract_headings_separate_columns` function parses the input JSON (`doc`) to identify headings  \n",
    "  and classify them into hierarchical levels (Level 0 to Level 3).\n",
    "- Associated text is grouped under the appropriate headings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. **Flatten the Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Headings and text are flattened into single rows to facilitate further transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. **Create a Pandas DataFrame**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The resulting data is stored in a DataFrame with clearly defined columns:  \n",
    "  **Page**, **Level 0 to Level 3**, **Text**, **Label**, **Parent**, and a concatenated levels column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. **Extract Paragraph Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A helper function, `extract_number`, extracts numeric paragraph identifiers at the start of the text.  \n",
    "  Missing numbers are forward-filled for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. **Join rows, which belong to the same paragraph**\n",
    "\n",
    "- During the Docling processing some paragraphs are split and need to be joined again"

In the ECB's understanding and for the purposes of paragraph 211, the following principles apply. \\n(a) For PD models and regarding the analysis of the predictive power envisaged by paragraph 218(c) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD: \\n(i) the analysis should be performed at grade level; for institutions using direct PD estimates, it should be performed at a sufficient level of granularity; \\n(ii) institutions should use a range of metrics to assess predictive ability, including statistical tests and graphical analysis of the evolution of default rates and PD. \\n(b) The analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(i) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD should also consider, for CCFs, whether including the most recent data leads to a significant change in the LRA CCF or downturn CCF. \\n(c) For LGD models that result from a combination of different components (for example, secured and unsecured components), the back-testing analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(ii) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD should be run at both component and facility level. \\n(d) In addition, institutions should consider in their frameworks for the review of estimates the availability of data for different exposure types, taking into account the specificities of the model architecture, including the existing and potential risk drivers, under paragraph 220 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. When data are scarce, they should use complementary analyses for those exposure types where quantitative measures prove inconclusive as a result, for example, of the low number of exposures available. \\n(e) Where internal data are not considered sufficient to establish fixed targets and tolerances for defined metrics and tools to assess the performance of the PD model in terms of risk differentiation, institutions should define and put in place the appropriate actions to address this. 98 These actions could encompass, for example, the use of complementary analyses for those cases where the results for the application of metrics and tools are proven to be inconclusive. \\n(f) When external credit bureau scores or ratings are used as the main (or one of the main) driver(s) of the internal rating, in cases where significant changes are applied to the credit bureau scoring institutions should consider the possibility of adjusting their internal data following the changes applied to the score, and whenever the input variables are no longer considered appropriate in their credit rating process.</td>\n",

In the case of material models where the assignment of the grade is based on a statistical model and where there is a risk that slight changes in the ranking of the obligors, or in the boundaries between grades, could lead to significant changes in the RWEA in that portfolio, the framework referred to in paragraph 211 should also include an analysis of whether the inclusion of the most recent data in the RDS used for model development would lead to materially different model outcomes. This analysis should be conducted on a three-yearly basis, or more often, depending on the materiality of the model. The analysis should consider, in particular, whether the discriminatory power of the PD, LGD or CCF models would be materially increased when re-estimating the model parameters on the basis of the updated RDS. Portfolios should be considered as falling into this category when, for example: (i) a limited number of obligors represent an important share of the total exposure; or (ii) exposures are concentrated near the boundaries between two grades.</td>\n",

In accordance with Article 386(3) of the CRR, eligible CVA hedges that are included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk must not be included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for specific risk of debt instruments. The ECB therefore considers that they should be included in the scope of calculation of own funds requirements for general risk (for example, included in the VaR and sVaR, or treated through the framework for risks-not-in-the-VaR or sVaR engine - see Section 7). Additionally, other (i.e. non-eligible) CVA hedges in the regulatory trading book should be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk (i.e. general and specific risk). The ECB considers that positions entered into with the purpose of hedging CVA risks for counterparties which are exempted from the own funds requirement for CVA risk, in accordance with Article 382(4) of the CRR, should also be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk (i.e. general and specific risk).</td>\n",

       "      <td>11. In accordance with Article 362 of the CRR, position risk on a traded debt instrument may be divided into two components: specific risk and general risk. In accordance with the same article, general risk of traded debt instruments refers to the risk of a price change due to a change in the level of interest rates. The ECB considers that this is a reference to risk-free interest rates and does not include counterparty credit spread risk (i.e. the risk of a price change due to a change in the credit spread of the counterparty to a transaction). In accordance with the same article, specific risk of debt instruments refers to the risk of a price change due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The ECB considers that this definition of specific risk does not include counterparty credit spread risk. Consistent with this interpretation, the ECB considers that counterparty credit spread risk does not fall under the definition of either general or specific risk, cannot be included in the scope of the IMA and is not part of the actual or hypothetical profit and loss (P&amp;L) for back-testing.</td>\n",

Back-to-back transactions in the regulatory trading book (i.e. transactions exactly matched with a third-party transaction) are generally included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. The ECB considers that back-to-back transactions included in the scope of the internal model may be excluded from the calculation of own funds requirements, provided that institutions are able to document them and demonstrate that there are no residual market risks stemming from these transactions. However, potential P&amp;L generated by these back-to-back transactions should be considered in the back-testing (for those P&amp;L components that are not excluded from the actual or hypothetical P&amp;L). This is because, although they do not carry residual market risks, such back-to-back transactions could generate P&amp;L (for example, at the inception of the trade, or where the transaction is closed before maturity).</td>\n",

In the understanding of the ECB, to reflect the dispersion of the statistical estimators as set out in paragraph 43(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD, institutions should adopt the following approach. \\n(a) For PD, estimate an MoC to account for statistical uncertainty/sampling error affecting the LRA estimate at grade/pool level. This MoC should be based on the distribution of the estimator, which is the average of one-year default rates of the grade/pool across time (i.e. the distribution of (ΣDR$_{t}$) T / ), considering that the uncertainty is primarily driven by the statistical uncertainty of each one-year default rate and the length of the time series. As a result, it is expected that the lower the number of observations per grade and the shorter the time series are, the higher the MoC of the grade should be.   \n",

When using direct PD estimates, the MoC is based on the distribution of this direct PD estimator (which includes the risk differentiation function), implicitly reflecting the uncertainty of the LRA. When calibration is performed at calibration segment level, the general estimation error may be computed at that level when the statistical uncertainty/sampling error is neither significantly different across grades or PD sub-ranges nor significantly different between the calibration segment level and the grades or PD sub-ranges level. \\n(b) Similarly, for LGD and CCF, estimate an MoC to account for statistical uncertainty/sampling error affecting the final estimates. This MoC should be defined on the basis of the distribution of the estimators, considering that their uncertainty is primarily driven by the statistical uncertainty of the observations used to compute the long-run and downturn estimates and the length of the time series.   \n",

       "1137  213. In the ECB's understanding and for the purposes of paragraph 211, the following principles apply. \\n(a) For PD models and regarding the analysis of the predictive power envisaged by paragraph 218(c) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD: \\n(i) the analysis should be performed at grade level; for institutions using direct PD estimates, it should be performed at a sufficient level of granularity; \\n(ii) institutions should use a range of metrics to assess predictive ability, including statistical tests and graphical analysis of the evolution of default rates and PD. \\n(b) The analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(i) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD should also consider, for CCFs, whether including the most recent data leads to a significant change in the LRA CCF or downturn CCF. \\n(c) For LGD models that result from a combination of different components (for example, secured and unsecured components), the back-testing analysis referred to in paragraph 218(c)(ii) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD should be run at both component and facility level. \\n(d) In addition, institutions should consider in their frameworks for the review of estimates the availability of data for different exposure types, taking into account the specificities of the model architecture, including the existing and potential risk drivers, under paragraph 220 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD. When data are scarce, they should use complementary analyses for those exposure types where quantitative measures prove inconclusive as a result, for example, of the low number of exposures available. \\n(e) Where internal data are not considered sufficient to establish fixed targets and tolerances for defined metrics and tools to assess the performance of the PD model in terms of risk differentiation, institutions should define and put in place the appropriate actions to address this. 98 These actions could encompass, for example, the use of complementary analyses for those cases where the results for the application of metrics and tools are proven to be inconclusive. \\n(f) When external credit bureau scores or ratings are used as the main (or one of the main) driver(s) of the internal rating, in cases where significant changes are applied to the credit bureau scoring institutions should consider the possibility of adjusting their internal data following the changes applied to the score, and whenever the input variables are no longer considered appropriate in their credit rating process.   \n",

In the case of material models where the assignment of the grade is based on a statistical model and where there is a risk that slight changes in the ranking of the obligors, or in the boundaries between grades, could lead to significant changes in the RWEA in that portfolio, the framework referred to in paragraph 211 should also include an analysis of whether the inclusion of the most recent data in the RDS used for model development would lead to materially different model outcomes. This analysis should be conducted on a three-yearly basis, or more often, depending on the materiality of the model. The analysis should consider, in particular, whether the discriminatory power of the PD, LGD or CCF models would be materially increased when re-estimating the model parameters on the basis of the updated RDS. Portfolios should be considered as falling into this category when, for example: (i) a limited number of obligors represent an important share of the total exposure; or (ii) exposures are concentrated near the boundaries between two grades.   \n",

When the number of default observations is low, to analyse whether the main drivers of the observed defaults are appropriately reflected in the model in accordance with Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR 99 institutions should analyse individual defaults (or at least a sample of them where the number of defaults makes analysing all of them unduly burdensome). However, the model should not be adapted simply to fit singular events from the institution's file review.   \n",

In accordance with Article 172(3) of the CRR, for grade and pool assignments institutions must document those situations in which human judgement may override the inputs or outputs of the assignment process. In addition, institutions must complement the statistical model by human judgement and human oversight to review model-based assignments and ensure that the models are used appropriately. 100 Furthermore, review procedures must be designed to find and limit errors associated with model weaknesses. 101 To comply with these requirements, institutions should assess the impact of the application of human judgement on risk differentiation capability (e.g. on discriminatory power), under paragraph 218(b) of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD.   \n",

The purpose of this chapter is to provide transparency on how the ECB understands a number of topics related to internal models used in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. It is important to note that this chapter does not aim to cover exhaustively all topics that could be subject to review during internal model investigations (such as, for example, model governance). The topics covered in the market risk chapter have been selected taking into account the requirements of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and focus on certain modelling aspects relating, for example, to regulatory back-testing of value-at-risk (VaR) models, to VaR and stressed VaR (sVaR) methodologies, and to the incremental default and migration risk charge (IRC) methodology.   \n",

In accordance with Article 104 of the CRR, institutions must have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining which positions to include in the trading book for the purpose of calculating their capital requirements (referred to in this guide as the \"regulatory trading book\"). The ECB considers that, in this context and in accordance with Article 4(1)(86) of the CRR, \"positions\" refers to positions in financial instruments (as defined in Article 4(1)(50) of the CRR) and commodities, and not to risk positions as referred to in the glossary included in this guide. The ECB understands that positions that are classified as \"held for trading\" for accounting purposes are presumed to be included in the regulatory trading book. Therefore, institutions should be able to list all positions that are classified as \"held for trading\" for accounting purposes but not included in the regulatory trading book, and should be able to justify these exclusions.   \n",

As the instruments and transactions are included either in the regulatory trading book or in the non-regulatory trading book (referred to in this guide as the \"banking book\"), the ECB understands that the policies required by Article 104 of the CRR should also encompass rules for moving instruments between the regulatory trading book and the banking book.   \n",

In order for the ECB to assess the appropriateness and implementation of the policies and procedures for determining which positions to include in the regulatory trading book, the ECB can, on the basis of Article 10 of the SSM Regulation, require institutions to provide a list of types of positions and instruments allocated to the regulatory trading or the banking book, identify all related transactions including their relevant characteristics, and justify such allocation.   \n",

In accordance with Article 106(1) of the CRR, internal hedges (as defined in Article 4(1)(96) of the CRR) must be properly documented and not be primarily intended to avoid or reduce own funds requirements. Therefore, institutions should be able to identify 9 all internal hedges and should document their treatment for the purpose of calculating own funds requirements for market risk. In accordance with Article 106(1)(d) of the CRR, the market risk that is generated by an internal hedge must be dynamically managed in the regulatory trading book within the authorised limits. For this reason, the ECB considers that proper documentation should distinguish between \\n(a) hedges of a banking book credit risk exposure (or counterparty credit risk exposure) using an internal risk transfer with the regulatory trading book; \\n(b) hedges of a banking book equity risk exposure using a hedging instrument purchased from the market through the regulatory trading book; \\n(c) hedges of a banking book interest rate risk exposure using an internal risk transfer with the regulatory trading book; \\n(d) hedges of a banking book foreign exchange risk exposure using an internal risk transfer with the regulatory trading book; \\n(e) hedges of a banking book commodity risk exposure using an internal risk transfer with the regulatory trading book; \\n(f) eligible hedges (as defined in Article 386(1) of the CRR) that are included in the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) capital charge.   \n",

In accordance with Article 386(3) of the CRR, eligible CVA hedges that are included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for CVA risk must not be included in the calculation of the own funds requirements for specific risk of debt instruments. The ECB therefore considers that they should be included in the scope of calculation of own funds requirements for general risk (for example, included in the VaR and sVaR, or treated through the framework for risks-not-in-the-VaR or sVaR engine - see Section 7). Additionally, other (i.e. non-eligible) CVA hedges in the regulatory trading book should be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk (i.e. general and specific risk). The ECB considers that positions entered into with the purpose of hedging CVA risks for counterparties which are exempted from the own funds requirement for CVA risk, in accordance with Article 382(4) of the CRR, should also be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk (i.e. general and specific risk).   \n",

In accordance with Article 362 of the CRR, position risk on a traded debt instrument may be divided into two components: specific risk and general risk. In accordance with the same article, general risk of traded debt instruments refers to the risk of a price change due to a change in the level of interest rates. The ECB considers that this is a reference to risk-free interest rates and does not include counterparty credit spread risk (i.e. the risk of a price change due to a change in the credit spread of the counterparty to a transaction). In accordance with the same article, specific risk of debt instruments refers to the risk of a price change due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument. The ECB considers that this definition of specific risk does not include counterparty credit spread risk. Consistent with this interpretation, the ECB considers that counterparty credit spread risk does not fall under the definition of either general or specific risk, cannot be included in the scope of the IMA and is not part of the actual or hypothetical profit and loss (P&L) for back-testing.   \n",

Back-to-back transactions in the regulatory trading book (i.e. transactions exactly matched with a third-party transaction) are generally included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. The ECB considers that back-to-back transactions included in the scope of the internal model may be excluded from the calculation of own funds requirements, provided that institutions are able to document them and demonstrate that there are no residual market risks stemming from these transactions. However, potential P&L generated by these back-to-back transactions should be considered in the back-testing (for those P&L components that are not excluded from the actual or hypothetical P&L). This is because, although they do not carry residual market risks, such back-to-back transactions could generate P&L (for example, at the inception of the trade, or where the transaction is closed before maturity).   \n",

The ECB understands that instruments in the regulatory trading book which are lent out or repoed out should be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. Conversely, instruments borrowed/obtained via securities lending or reverse repo should not be included in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. This is because the securities lending or repo transaction does not transfer the market risk of the security. Furthermore, the market risk of the securities lending or repo transaction should be captured (if this transaction is recorded in the trading book).   \n",
